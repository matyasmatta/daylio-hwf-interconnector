an especially gorgeous evening and night with noc vědců and a vědec of my very own 🍃🫂<br><br><i>jinak, z jiného soudku, jsem byl dnes na ORL, protože mi v tom krku doopravdy pořád bolí, tak jsem se tam minulý týden objednal, tam, kam jsi mi maminko posílala před dvěma lety, Na Homolku, tak jsem tam byl a byl tam úplně perfektní pan doktor, všechno vyslechl a pak udělal endoskopii na hlasivky a na tom velkým monitoru mi vysvětlil, že to opravdu je zanícené, a že to dělá reflux, že ty léky co mi na to dávali tak ad hoc nebyly dobra metoda, že ať si dám fakt pozor na dietu, jako doopravdy, a že mi dá jiné lepší léky, pak dokonce i vytáhl příručku abych porovnal, jak to mám zarudlé, že to není katastrofa ale ani to není dobré, byl úplně perfektní 🤩 Praha je Praha...po dvou letech na to nekdo definitivně přišel, sice to není vyléčený, ale je to první krok 🙂‍↕️<\/i><br><br><i>[27\/09, 17:21] Matyáš Matta: byl jsem fakt špatnej a už jsem fakt nevěděl co jako se sebou, protože jsou to dva roky co mi bolí v krku a já už fakt nevím, já jsem se snažil dodržovat tu dietu a být úplně tipťop ale faktem jest, že když je něco z vlastní iniciativy, tak spoléhám na svůj úsudek, a já nejsem doktor, tak ho často poruším<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:23] Matyáš Matta: tak jsem se po škole sebral a jen jsem na ORL ambulanci do nemocnice na homolce, autobusem z anděla, to je vždycky zvláštní protože člověk jede kolem motola a Motol je úplně monumentálně gigantickej<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:24] Matyáš Matta: je to takovej zvláštní druh úzkosti, teskna, protože vidíš jak zle by mohlo být, když jedeš kolem dětský onkologie, ale zároveň víš, že ani teď ti není vůbec příjemně<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:25] Matyáš Matta: tak jsem tam přišel a paní mi prostě objednala na další pátek, což bylo včera<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:25] Matyáš Matta: já jsem neměl vůbec žádný očekávání, už jsem byl u toooolika lékařů a nikdy nikdo neměl nic konstitutivního, vždycky se na mě jen podívali a řekli že mi nic není, že žádný zánět nevidí a adios<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:27] Matyáš Matta: ono se zdá sice, že teď jsou věci lepší, a jako jo, lépe jsem se s tím zžil a objektivně se necítím tak nemocně, ale nic to nemění na tom, že jsem 24\/7 v bolesti a je mi fakt nepříjemno<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:27] Matyáš Matta: tak jsem tam s těmahle nulovýma očekáváníma vešel do tý ambulance, už poxtý, to dobře víš<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:27] Matyáš Matta: a byl jsem rázem úplně shick shack shock<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:28] Matyáš Matta: protože ten pán doktor si mě první posadil a nechal mě to v klidu všechno vysvětlit, všechno co mi na tom trápí, co jsem zkoušel, čeho jsem si všiml, o co jsem se pokoušel měnit, pověděl jsem mu o refluxu teorii, o dietě, o mononukleóze, o tom že si vlastně ani nevěřím že to není psychicky, že jsem ochotnej jít na těžký antidepresiva a že prostě taková je situace<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:29] Matyáš Matta: on řekl, že se na mě pořádně podívá, že chápe moji frustraci když se to tak vleče a že nemá smysl to uzavírat jako psychicky dokud je nevyřadí všechno ostatní<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:30] Matyáš Matta: tak se mi podíval do krku, a nahoře říkal že nevidí vůbec nic, že to zanícené není, ale pak se podíval na hlasivky a na hlasivkách viděl docela výrazné zarudnutí, řekl že to dělá jedině reflux, ukázal mi příručku co tam měl, abych sám porovnal, říkal, že jediná cesta jsou poctivě léky, ale fakt poctivě, a dieta, fakt striktní, vytiskl mi brožuru<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:30] Matyáš Matta: a já jsem byl úplně<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:30] Matyáš Matta: 🥹🥹🥹<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:31] Matyáš Matta: all it took bylo dva roky na to, aby nekdo KONEČNĚ přišel na to, že to FAKT není v mojí hlavě a FAKT mě to bolí?????<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:31] Matyáš Matta: fucking. crazy.<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:32] Matyáš Matta: all it took bylo hodně doktorů, snažil jsem se dopočítat, aspoň 10 jich dělalo mi úplně to samý vyšetření reálně, šílený<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:35] Matyáš Matta: poprvý po dvou letech vím definitivně co mám dělat a není to jenom výplod moji fantazie a diagnostiky, ale opírá se to o fakta a skutečný pozorování<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:35] Matyáš Matta: reálně nedokážu slovama popsat jak moc to je důležitý<\/i><br><i>[27\/09, 17:35] Matyáš Matta: vezmi si že to začalo v době ještě před anežkou a od

haven't really excelled at writing my diary this week so let's fix that 💫<br><br>first and foremost, I'm still bothered by the throat substantially, going for a checkup soon enough which is a good thing unequivocally, but nonetheless, it's tough, we're currently faced with a dilemma of some sort, if you will, either<br><ul><li>it's more of a reflux problem which aligns well with the sole period of remission I've experienced and the fact that walking seems to help, and that I do actually occasionally get reflux and sense it 😞 this would require diet which is honestly a really hard thing to do and reinforces the idea that something is wrong with me<\/li><li>it's more of a sensitivity problem which aligns well with the onset, the chronic pain which isn't very episodic and the fact that there are no clear triggers with respect to even known triggers like coffee or chocolate, this feels more actionable even though it arguably isn't, it's somewhat less limiting and makes sense too 🧙‍♂️<\/li><\/ul>and...I don't know where we go from here, probably try if eating the plainest of plain is any help, maybe, because recently I've been eating too many lentils which made me worse, yoghurts also are the kind of thing I certainly shouldn't eat in larger quantities, obviously it's really hard...really <i>really <\/i>hard, the only thing making is mildly more optimistic is the fact that 1) it's extremely unlikely to get any worse id est it's extremely stable, 2) doesn't limit me in the true sense of the word and lastly 3) we've seen it fully remit ✨✨✨✨ just let that happen once again please 🥺 and then just silence forever...that would be lovely, it quite possibly is reflux, the hardship comes from how to deal with it, either diet works or it doesn't, we've got to stay patient throughout, may it provide at least some comfort that it's gradually extremely gradually getting better and there is no malaise to speak of 🧚‍♂️<br><br>the other more general thing is...the tendencies in society, why does everyone suddenly have issues similar to these? it must be somehow linked, I refuse to believe it's always been this way...what do we do about it though? it's the all we need is <i>change <\/i>fallacy that I've seen so many times, change okay, but how? it's those vague things that get us nowhere 😞<br><ul><li>I wish I could once a week just sit down and let my mind wander off watching something silly on TV, I know I'm up for a really tough school and that's not great, <i>buuuuuut <\/i>those languid evenings of march really had some magic ✨ (thanks amitriptyline)<\/li><li>I wish I could do diaphragmatic breathing more often and just calm down like I did on Saturday because <i>somehow <\/i>it works and I know a person like Stella or my grandma have a lot of that inner peace instilled in them ✨<\/li><\/ul>I always have these visions of better tomorrows, after change is undertaken, but what change, exactly? are you sure that there is a way as simple as <i>change<\/i>? I also know this isn't exclusive solely to the sore throat problem, but rather to the whole family of issues stemming from hypertense nervous system that's hyperexcitable and hyperreactive to every single context possible 🥱 does that mean it solves the sore throat? hell no, but broad dysregulation along the gut-brain axis definitely plays a role, of which I'm sorry and sure at the same time 🙂‍↔️<br><br>anyways, school! 🏫 the good thing is I'm managing with no severe bouts of malaise or illness thoughts, it's just sore throat which makes it all the more annoying, something so benign... nevertheless, I'm enjoying it so far quite a bit, I'm reasonably clever and understand it reasonably well, I'm also grateful for having met quite a few solid people that means I have some system of being able to rely on, that's certainly good🙏 I'm grateful it's no longer just a very vague unknown and rather quite a specific thing that is currently in my life 🫶<br><br>my life feels...still bipolar, less than in spring though, friday, saturday, sunday, I had a blast, pain or not, I was on fire 🔥 but now I'm like...meh, not feeling explicitly amazing, nothing special in the sense that ugh the sore throat is still here which is obnoxious but eh what can you do 🥺<br><br>what is beautiful is stella, of course 🫂 she bought me that stuffed lillepullt cat from IKEA which is just so adorable I love it 💕 it's wonderful...and the memory of wanting to just cuddle with her forever, it's a cute one, she's a cute one, a really cute one, that makes me really happy 🥰<br><br><br>","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1166,1135,1101,1170,1175],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":33026,"minute":14,"hour":22,"day":23,"month":8,"year":2025,"datetime":1758658453613,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1166,1135,1183,1101,1108,1170,1175],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":33025,"minute":6,"hour":9,"day":22,"month":8,"year":2025,"datetime":1758524779023,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"[21\/09, 22:03] Matyáš Matta: stelluško moje já jsem sem přišel do ložnice jenom otevřít okno, rozsvítil jsem a byl jsem jako awwww to je tak strašně moc cute 🥰🥰 ty seš tak strašně moc cute 🥰🥰 dneska jsem koukal na nějaký school of life video https:\/\/youtu.be\/CefMjihQj1U a byl jsem jako že ty seš na mě tak hodná že na se z tebe úplně rozplynu 🫂🫂 já většinou ani nemám slova kterýma bych to popsal jak strašně moc tě mám rád a jenom bych tě objal jako jsem tě objal v noci protože tím jediným mi přijde že to vyjádřím 🥰 tak jsem jako miluju tě stelluško protože i když co já vím co to znamena a člověk to nesmí nadužívat ale jestli to znamená že jsi na mě strašně moc hodná, že tě mám strašně moc rád, že bych se k tobě přitulil a koupil ti všechny kytičky a kočičky světa tak přesně to bych udělal 🥰 dneska jsem si četl co jsem ti onehdy psal v tom červenci že bychom věci měli jen tak nechat plynout a četl jsem si co i ty jsi tehdy psala a uvědomil jsem si že tě mám ještě o tolik víc rád než tehdy to je crazy, jsi moc skvělá stelluško a děkuju ti za všechno 🥰<br><br>[21\/09, 22:36] Stelluška ✨: Teď jsem to video doukoukala 🫂 Ty jsi taaaaak hodnej a milej, úplně hodňoučkej a miloučkej 🥰 já nemám slov a teď jsem z tvý zprávy úplně jakože 🥰🥹☺️🫂 mám tě moc moc ráda a těším se, až tě obejmu a řeknu ti něco krásnýho a od srdíčka, protože irl to má větší hloubku, i když irl je někdy těžší věci říkat než je takhle psát, ale o to víc to je hodnotnější 😌 to, co jsi napsal v červenci, tak byl jeden ze zásadních momentů, protože ze mě spadl ten neklid a napětí a byla jsem ty jo, mám tě v oblibě víc, než jsem myslela 🫂 a druhý zásadní moment bylo ofc povídání a trávení času o samotě s tebou na teambuildingu 🥰<br><br>[22\/09, 00:05] Stelluška ✨: Teď jsem se na půl hodiny ztratila v našich dávných zprávách. Musím říct, že mi přijde, že já a ty jsme byli jiný osoby. Zkrátka že jsi to ty, s kým komunikuju takhle teď a taky s tebou chodím 🫂😙 proto je pro mě takový zvláštní to zpětně číst, neboť díky svým zprávám se přesunu do toho období, protože teď tě mám úplně mega ráda a tehdá to byla jen počáteční obliba a ze sebe tam vůči tobě ještě necítím tu lásku v těch daaavných dobách, proto si to už nechci moc číst 🥺 i když mi to nevadí s tebou irl rozebírat a vzpomínat, ale číst to, to už nějak jo. Každopádně bývaly doby, co nám dělalo problém říkat, jak se máme rádi a jiný věci. To už zvládáme mnohem lépe a jsem za to ráda 🥰<br><br>[22\/09, 00:26] Stelluška ✨: Matýsku, jsem ráda, že tě mám a že jsem tě poznala. Když si uvědomím, že tě znám od 8. 7., od 13. 7., záleží jak to brát, viď haha, nebo teoreticky od toho tmb, každopádně to nějak dlouho není. Za tu dobu jsem si tě úplně oblíbila a mám tě ráda čím dál tím víc 🥰 ty mě dokážeš vždycky něčím úplně pozitivně překvapit, že se divím, že to je ještě možný. Jsi fakt úžasnej a za všechno ti moc děkuju. Ráda s tebou trávím čas, cítím se s tebou v bezpečí 🫂 vím, že jsi říkal, že se ti ta nová, což už je nějaká doba, ale budiž, songa od sombra nějak nezdá či co hahaha, ale přesto musím z 12 to 12 citovat in a room full of people, I look for you 🗣🗣🗣 těším se na tebe, na pojmenování kočiček a na rozkvétání naší lásky. Teď bych tě nejradši objala 🫂 mám tě ráda, zlatíčko moje, doufám, že teď spíš. Hezky se vyspi a zítra všechno zvládni. Dobrou noc, Matýsku 😽<br>[22\/09, 07:10] Matyáš Matta: vyspal jsem se moc pěkně, i když byla trochu horká noc že jsem si musel vzít tenčí deku abych usnul, a mouchy dělaly strašnej bordel i když jsem je všechny vymlátil 😹 ale hezky jsem si večer sednul a byl jsem jako musim stellince napsat něco cute 🥰<br><br>[22\/09, 07:12] Matyáš Matta: viděl jsem tvou zprávu ještě na telefonu hahah pro tebe bych si to zobrazení zapnul, ale pro honzu a spol ne takže to neudělám 😿 ono by mě pak obtěžovali s tím na co všechno jsem neodpověděl i když jsem třeba ještě neměl prostor se nad tím zamyslet...taky budu nejradši když mi to povíš irl stellinko 🫂 já vím hahah já nevím jak jsme usnuli ani, to nebylo plánovaný, a pak jsme se vzbudili a byli vzhůru a pak zas nějak šli spát 😹 už ani nevím, každopádně když naše noc neměla tak pevnou hranici tak jsem nevěděl kdy ti mám popřát dobrou noc zlatíčko moje 😹<br><br>[22\/09, 07:20] Matyáš Matta: taky jsem nad tím přemýšlel, že jsme se oba chovali jinak, já jsem tě měl rád celkem tehdy, tak vím, že jsem se snažil a vždycky když jsi mi na \"dobré ráno 🫶\" napsala \"Dobré ráno 🫶\" tak to mi stačilo hihihi<br><br>[22\/09, 07:26] Matyáš Matta: ale je pravda že jsem si občas říkal, že si píšeme trochu zvláštní věci, protože ty bys mi tu poslala nějakej screen kde řešíš SH a já bych byl jako ok 🗣️🗣️ a naopak já jsem se občas choval trochu frajírkovsky jako svůj bratr a to taky nejsem já 🗣️🗣️ nevím, ty jsi asi pořád stejná, možná jenom že tě znám tak už mi nic nepřijde zvláštní, v létě jsi byla víc závislák 🗣️🗣️ ale i tak jsi byla cutie to bezesporu 😊 ale máme to teďka hezčí, můžu ti říkat jak tě mám rád ale přijde mi že máme lepší konverzace 🫶<br><br>[22\/09, 07:37] Matyáš Matta: vím že dřív jsem byl častěji jako že je něco o čem bych se s tebou bavil nebo co bych ti rekl ale nejde to, a teďka jsem tak někdy ale už méně, možná už jsem víc zvyklej na ten typ věcí co se s tebou pěkně řeší 🫂 tak jsem zjistil, že ty spíš řešíš otázky užšího kontextu, spíš lidi kolem sebe a život přímo kolem sebe, než otázky širšího kontextu, jako jsou politický nebo společenský věci, a došel jsem k názoru, že to hodně je spojené s tvojí osobností, jak se obecně z takových věcí stresuješ méně, nebo ani ne stres není dobrý slovo, ale prostě ty tak bez odporu pluješ životem zatímco mi přijde že já, ale někteří víc, se tak plácáme 😹 já když jsem od tebe jel v tu sobotu tak jsem byl strašně v klidu z nějakýho důvodu, a tiky co se mi normálně hrozně zhorší když špatně spím byly celkem gone, a hodně z toho byl důsledek tebe protože nevim říkal jsem si měl bych být tak v klidu jako stellinka 🫂 do určitý míry mi připomínáš naší babi, kterou mám neskutečně rád kvůli tomu, na jaře jsem měl takový dva módy, jak jsem bral prášky, tak jsem půl týdne se cítil fakt fyzicky zle a tak jako tehdy normálně, a půlku týdne uuplne v pořádku a život byl tak fajn, a v tý fajn dny jsem vždycky jel k babi, skočil ji nakoupit a ona mi vzala na oběd, a strávili jsme spolu den, a to bylo reálně všechno, vždycky jsme seděli v obýváku a ona by se mě ptala co je novýho a mezitím by koukala na televizi a strašně chillovala, a možná kvůli tomu jsem se taky cítil strašně v klidu, každopádně ty na mě máš stejný blahodárný efekt, sice stejně jako u moji babi je crazy kolik času trávíš doma, ale žiješ takovou udržitelnější rychlostí že mi přijde že se z toho nikdy nezblázníš, nejsi produktivní každou minutu, mně ujel trolejbus v tu sobotu ale byl jsem jako nu co tak se projdu a já nevím, něco na tom bylo, brát věci tak jak přijdou 💫<br><br>[22\/09, 08:00] Matyáš Matta: taky jsi o hodně víc všímavá než třeba honza nebo než obecně většina mých přátel, třeba ty tiky co mám, když jsem s honzou byl v anglii tak jsem je měl určitě stejně špatný jako v tom červenci když jsem tě poprvý viděl, ale on si toho za celý týden prej nevšiml, přitom to bylo fakt hodně zjevný, a takových věcí je spousta co ty by sis všimla, honza sám má taky takový divný tikopohyby po jídle třeba, možná proto si toho nevšimá, ale obecně u něj mi přijde že hodně ignoruje sám sebe, v tom nealtruistickým smyslu, v tom smyslu že fakt kašle na užší kontext sebe a svýho života, třeba svýho zdraví, a místo toho to zdánlivě zachraňuje širším kontextem ve formě zvaž vědu, což ale podle mě je spíš zástěrka, nemůže být člověk šťastný se světem kolem pokud první není šťastný sám se sebou ✨ a ty vypadáš že jsi hodně v pohodě sama se sebou, možná nejsi nejproduktivnější nebo nejefektivnější, ale přijde mi, že si od tebe mám hodně co vzít a mám radost že s tebou můžu trávit čas 🫂<br>[22\/09, 08:01] Matyáš Matta: hahaha proti ty písničce nic moc nemám, jen vím, že mi ji posílala Lucka a byla jako wake up babe new sombr song just dropped 🗣️ in a room full of people I'd look for you too protože jsi úplně definice člověka s kterým se cítím komfortně 🫂<br><br>[22\/09, 08:25] Matyáš Matta: když nad tím tak přemýšlím tak jsme si asi řekli skoro úplně všechno co jsem si přál abysme spolu nějak historicky probrali, myslim, že jsem si ti i celkem vylil srdíčko ohledně svého ochoření a občas celkem yappuju o blbostech viď 🗣️ možná jediný že jsme spolu neprodiskutovali sýr podle paní rojikový, jak jsi to onehdy nazvala, tak to prodiskutujeme až budeme spolu spát příště, to bysme měli, teď to máme vykomunikovaný tak provizorně 🗣️ ale jinak víš asi všechno co mám na mysli...a toho si moc vážím 🫂<br><br>[22\/09, 08:26] Matyáš Matta: strašně mi vždycky potěší když ti můžu kinda říct všechno a ty nejsi úplně jako jdipryčjsipryč já to nechci poslouchat- a i když třeba k tomu není co říct tak jsi jako zlatíčko moje 🫂 toho si vážím<br><br>[22\/09, 08:49] Matyáš Matta: ale stelluško musím říct že jsem si taky přečetl nějaké naše zprávy ale ne z až tak vzdálené minulosti, z toho srpna kdy jsme byli u tebe v domě, protože si pamatuju že jsme si tehdy řekli že jsme ve vztahu hihihihi 😙 po tom co jsme papali horkou kaši samozřejmě...ale mně přišlo úplně crazy že tě vůbec napadlo že bych tě nějak odpouštěl, to pro mě je nepředstavitelný 🫂 jako jo někdy jsem si tebou nejistý, ale podle mě to spíš vychází moji nejistotou sám se sebou než tebou, asi taky nejsi dokonalá ale damn jsi úžasná a mám tě rád taková jaká jsi, a je pravda že dřív jsem byl úplně 😞😞 že se něco bojím ti říct ale faktem jest že to je spíš můj problém protože jsem zjistil že stejný problém mám třeba se svými rodiči nebo i dalšími blízkými lidmi, třeba i s honzou v některých ohledech, a koneckonců teď už ti říkám hoooodne tak to mě moc těší 💫<br><br>[22\/09, 08:52] Matyáš Matta: ale btw to je moc zajímavá věc který by sis určitě všimla kdyby jsi mě často viděla v různých prostředích, ale já mám třeba hroznou tendenci mimikry, já jsem hodně převzal tvůj styl psaní a myslím že i některý fyzický mimický prvky jsem po tobě převzal, já jsem to diskutoval s chatem a ono je to evoluční výhoda protože máme tendenci přebírat chování lidí který bereme jako vzor s kterým se chceme zalíbit, a možná proto já mám docela snadnou komunikaci s defacto kýmkoliv, protože já se zvládnu hrozně přizpůsobit, na druhou stranu jsem možná min sám sebou a snáz se nechám ovlivnit i vlivy, kterými bych neměl, to by mě zajímalo, jestli sis třeba toho všimla, podle mě na tmb to moc nešlo protože tam byli lidi podobnýho rázu chování jako ty, ale já dokážu vycházet i s

pochutnáme, udělat k tomu rýži nebo brambory a budeme mít vystaráno 🛐 lehkou rybu snad můžu a je to kreativnější než obvyklá moje strava<br><br>[17\/09, 21:19] Matyáš Matta: taaaak jsem se dneska měl přiměřeně pěkně, pořád přemýšlím nad svým zdravím, jsem rád že už mi většinou je celkem dobře co se týče jako pocitově fyzicky, to bylo před rokem touhle dobou mizerný mizerný, můžu uklízet celý odpoledne a cítím se fajn 😌<br><br>[17\/09, 21:22] Matyáš Matta: jen mi pořád <br>bolí v krku, na jednu stranu jsem moc rád že oproti minulému roku vím o hodně víc, je to taková až vědecká věc a je fajn, že už to není jedna velká děsivá věc který bych se jen bál, je to jen obtěžující věc který nevim jak se zbavit, a nejhorší je, že ani nevím s kým mam přijít na to jak se jí zbavit, všechno to je kinda moje zodpovědnost a ať člověk přijde k lékaři kamkoliv, tak ty rady jsou takové eh, moje máma ještě doporučovala nějaký celostní institut ale to já taky nevim, to se člověk strašně snadno stane obětí šmejdů a šarlatánů a to si pišme že nedělá dobrotu...i když by to moji rodiče zaplatili, odmítám chodit k lidem jejichž základem rad je trust me bro a prodávají panaceu, to nedává smysl...😿<br><br>[17\/09, 21:24] Matyáš Matta: tak zkusím jíst jinak, po dvou letech zkusím jíst jinak, jediný den kdy mi to doopravdy úplně zničehonic přešlo bylo někdy v červenci když jsem nějak tu dietu dodržoval, to nemohla být náhoda...ale je to takové složité, nevím, co je pro mě dobré, a co je pro mě špatné, a pořád se v tom učím nějak chodit plus si musím dávat pozor abych primárně jedl dost a do toho moje obsesivní snaha s tím nikoho neobtěžovat, kdybych vydržel měsíc jíst jen ovesnou kaši, kuře s bramborem a šunku s rýží, a nic se nestalo, pak jó, pak bych mohl jít k šarlatánům o radu, ale to se nestalo, a já se nevzdám<br><br>[17\/09, 21:26] Matyáš Matta: mám radost z dnešního úklidu, je tu moc hezky, a mám celkem radost ze školy, i když můj stav není ani zdaleka perfektní, a naivní víra že v dohledné době bude mi asi nijak nepomůže, tak i ten aktuální stav umožňuje věcem přiměřeně rozumět, přiměřeně se soustředit, přiměřeně se učit, a mám radost, že jsem poznal nové lidi, kteří jsou milí, trochu političtí, zas jsou jiní než ty, jiní než mí jiní kamarádi, a to je taky dobře, člověk musí mít pestrou stravu ale i pestré kamarádstvo 🛐<br><br>[17\/09, 21:28] Matyáš Matta: tak uvidíme, jestli mě bude bavit co jsem si vybral, ale musím říct, že mi to aspoň nějak leze do hlavy, a říkám si jó, je to pěkný, i když mi někde hluboko uvnitř trochu schází ta motivace proč to vlastně dělám a k čemu mě to vlastně vede, na jednu stranu může být špatně, že tohle spojení nepociťuju, protože naplno neodůvodním své činy, na stranu druhou je možná ona setrvačnost co mě sem dovedla trochu pomocí překlenout dobu ve které jsem trochu nejistější, ať už z jakéhokoliv důvodu, a za pár let si řeknu, že i když jsem tehdy úplně nevěděl co dělám, tak jsem rád, že jsem vystudoval co jsem vystudoval a umím co umím

svým souputníkům, ale ta přednáška byla úžasná, úplně randíkovská což mi moc potěšilo, ani mi neuspala což se po vydaném obědě zdalo nevyhnutelné...a pak při čekání na cvičení jsem potkal dva další kluky, pana jirku a dalšího kubu, myslím, tak jsme se zasmali že si jména stejně pamatovat nebudeme, že zítra zas, jeden byl z pevných látek, což je jen kousilínek ode mě, druhý byl nějaký reaktorář, cizí vody...ale milí kluci, jeden z ústí, druhej z třebíče (coincidentally 🗣️), na cvičení jsem seděl úplně u okna a mým jediným sousedem se stal milý klučina, sportovnější, v počtech méně zběhlý, další Matěj, koukal ke mně na výsledky a já s ním diskutoval jeho stylový android tablet, milý kluk, radil jsem mu, takový můj nový ondra knížek (můj starý spolusedici), dělá inženýrství plazmatu, takže o fous vedle, ale pořád to není částicová věda, rozloučil jsem se s ním a běžel na palackého a ani nevím jak jsem to udělal ale za 40 minut od vyběhnutí ze cvika jsem otevřel dveře od bytu

I spent years waiting for moments like these when my sore throat is all but gone and my health seems good, and now that I'm here, it's just...<i>a noise in the background??<\/i>&nbsp;what the fuck?? where is the gratitude you talked about!! where are those warm thoughts you promised to have once all this is nearing its end?! is it nearing the end?? what does it matter! what matters is that it no longer sieges control over me and that's <i>all <\/i>that matters!!<br><br>and I had a call with stella and it went surprisingly well given it was our first time over the telephone 😽 but then all of the olden insecurities dawned on me...maybe it was the way I had to very hurriedly end the call, I think the conversation went fairly well and we still do possess quite a lot of things to talk about, even if I feel like I'm just goddamn not enough these days&nbsp;<br><br>every single goddamn relationship that I made it out of alive ended with the very same phrasing of <i>I hope that you manage to find yourself somebody who can give you as much as you can give them<\/i>, every single one, and now that I'm for the first time I'm a relationship where I don't have to doubt the other party I end up...doubting myself and my feelings??! what the fuck??? you ask yourself, do I love her, and then those questions when asked at the wrong time make an anxiety spiral go wild, because she very well feels so for me, and I think...I <i>think<\/i>, I love her too, but do those words carry any more meaning than me saying I'm grateful for my health?? I know that when I'm with her, I really want to be with her, and don't want her to go, not once did I feel like I wanted her to go, and my instincts say...words speak louder than thoughts, and actions speak louder than words or any thoughts ever could... so what do my actions say??? that I want to spend time with her, that I really feel like she's so kind to me...honestly sometimes when we text I just get that awe which makes me think about how miraculous she is, but then...when we talk sometimes it just gets so shallow, because it's harder to talk deeper, I don't think it's a me problem, I think stella has it this way with every single person around her, vojta said, righteously in my opinion, that she had to have a very traumatic character building event in her life which made her kind of distrustful towards being very honest and instilled that escapist sense of humour that we all get when coping with some hardship, and as a clever saying says, sometimes humour isn't the best medicine, sometimes it's the worst, and stella knows that, she knows that communication is hard for her and I can really really <i>really <\/i>see her trying her fucking best every single time, trying to be candid and caring and open and open minded and all and I appreciate it so goddamn much, and she had the right mindset, she said that having a relationship to her means not just a commitment to be together, but a commitment to <i>build<\/i>&nbsp;together, to build back better and stronger and deeper and not just take it for granted in a TaK TAdY Mě MáŠ kind of way ✨ and for the love of god that's the mindset I can really get behind and agree with, so where are my doubts and why are they here??? I suppose they're just a static of the present moment, of so many uncertainties that it makes it hard to just be, I wish to just be, I hope to eat dinners with stella, evenings with cities skylines, morning with my tea while taking care of each other in sickness and in health, I need somebody to take care of, to hug when I need to, to kiss when I'm passionate, she's all that, but I was used to boom-and-bust relationships, this is much more calm, and rightly so, I don't need more static in my life now, still feels odd to say I'm sad my grandfather died, he's dead, but I don't feel sad, I cried at the funeral but I don't know how sad I feel, more broken than sad, more sad that I'm not sad than sad that he's not here, tragic thing, emotions dulled and blunted for the sake of what? sanity??? I admired him, he was the only person I could look up to intellectually and goddamn I did, but now...my limbic system doesn't even bother making an emotional response, it barely bothers one with stella unless she's with me in person, it makes me mad, it makes me puzzled, it makes me mad that now that my worst problem and deepest fear is gone, my mind has just come to something else, I hope

cry more? feel more? just insecure thoughts these are<br><br>...but the vibe was really cool with all the wind there, I felt like...this is a sign of the era we're rushing into as a civilisation...<i>turbulent<\/i>, nobody knows what we're doing and a divided cyprus is just the beginning...where are we headed now? no, it isn't the malaise like two years ago, but that slight sense

fired up cities skylines but that mattered even more was my choice of having downloaded a brand new scenario\/map for building a brand new public transit system 😎<br><br>and to say I <i>loved <\/i>the game would be an understatement, I adored it, I played for about three hours until it turned out I needed to get go chewing gum back to albert, annoyingly, but those were some of the most fun three hours I managed to spend, building my trains, huge transfer stations, trying to think up better ways to develop the city, I'm already immensely looking forward to playing the game once I'm back home...what a fun time it was, an amazingly good distraction for sure 😚<br><br>okay so I made a quick journey to get my chewing gum which they annoyingly only had the expensive one but okay and then

the sleep wasn't too excellent 😑 because I woke up quite a lot of times and the night was just a little too hot 😬 but that's okay and getting up I got downstairs to make some porridge for myself and honza, also found out I don't have my hygiene bag so I was just rottening in my own mess 🫟 okay that's okay<br><br>I responded to my lovely girlfriend stella and having eaten quite a nice breakfast we lingered for a while to write the zvaž vědu feedback on the new graphical identity 🫆 then we decided to head for a walk and that walk was LUSH really, at first honza kinda yapped about his relationship struggles which honestly I've heard enough about ngl 🗣️ but that's okay, later though we got to talking about the future of zvaž vědu and making it all just much less lame which I think is an amazing idea 💡 and in general it needs to be admitted that the conversations were really nice<br><br>having come back we made chicken which obviously took some 2 hours and I was understandably extremely hungry but hey we made it it wasn't as good as the chicken in February because both the chicken was kinda too moist (should have cooked for longer I suppose) and the potatoes were excessively starchy which made them not ideal for mashing, but that's okay, I finished my meal and had a nice time with that 😚 <br><br>then we had to obviously walk about because that's what my regimen tells me so we did and through that we shared some fascinating conversations where honza expanded on his suspicion of having depression, I expanded on my low grade dread from everything around me, and there was an extremely honest and extremely important conversation about honza saying that he doesn't really see himself as a scientist anymore, that he wishes to try some new things and is genuinely considering forgoing astronomy for becoming a pilot 🧑‍✈️ which I support for the sole reason that it's not lame as most of his other ideas 😙 he also did a shocking amount of soul searching regarding zvaž vědu and thinks it absolutely needs to be refreshed <br><br>having said that we finished it off by eating something, talking something, me answering to stella and in general the conversations were really nice

woke up and had a truly marvellous morning, not saying that this was <i>the highlight of the day <\/i>but damnit I made some chamomile tea and popped up WhatsApp on my desktop, read up on vaccinations and stuff, thinking about getting vaccinated not only against TBE but also influenza and covid, especially given that regular immunisation leads to improved outcomes in illness and post-infectious complications 😶‍🌫️<br><br>stella said she only got the mandatory vaccines and her family and her alike refuse to get any voluntary shots, she's quite anti-establishment, she doesn't want to be a victim of the pharma industry, I can't say I disagree, the question I'm meaning to ask her is if the vaccines were developed and administered uncoupled from financial profit, in a more communal scientific way, would you get them? if the research was very clear and detached from money, would you get them?🧐 she said well I fall sick and develop antibodies, and said one can develop post-infectious complications even from vaccinations, which is true, nothing to be said here, it's about the probabilities, not possibilities<br><br>okay then I went downstairs and had lunch but didn't manage to finish it as štěpan pulled over just a little too early so I hopped in the car with my fancy little digital camera and we got going, there was lucka, honza and david in addition to the driver, the ride was quite nice, no complaints, I was quite content here 😴 there was a little more hostility between honza and lucka than I had hoped for, but that's okay, that's just how it goes<br><br>we arrived at the beach and there we lingered just on the towels for a while and honestly the mood was subpar, but what could you do, we talked and I was kinda glad I saw david because he's my go to university student in prague for sure ✨ lucka got menstruation so she had to be taken to the pharmacy for the special tampons for water because a boy of hers was bound to come to the beach to see her and maybe us as well<br><br>soon enough we delved into the water on our paddle boards and that was so much fun, honza stayed there for the whole three hours, whereas me and david took a gap in between to talk about my study futures, very glad to have that chat, we jumped some šipky, talked about the future of zvaž vědu which was honestly adorable and then talked about girls and sex largely, where to my surprise david had stuff to say as he progressed to about the same stage as me and stella, I did hint honza something but not the climax part 〽️ so I think that I fared fairly well<br><br>the swimming and paddling was really fun but soon enough we had to get back and quickly dried ourselves up and went to the nearby restaurant to get a pizza for me and david while honza wanted something a bit more deluxe, we didn't have enough cash on us so we scrambled to get that but other than that the food was extremely tasty that needs to be said 😙 I did sort of give up on my diet as it's summer now and we have to follow through with eating enough rather than well, because enough &gt; well in terms of priority unfortunately 😑<br><br>I walked back to the car with štěpán and lucka and honestly lucka seems much less based than she used to, obviously the fact that she finds stella antipathic and just doesn't like her is one thing, I suppose that's her business and I'm here not to force anyone to like each other even though I might find it slightly sad, but moreover she broke up with this boy, ondra, just a couple weeks ago, barely a month, he was really really nice, we had a real conversation with lucka over the reasons and it basically came down to the fact that <i>he liked her too much <\/i>which is you know, happens, she wasn't willing to commit so much<br><br>he was also quite sad because she is not the person to show affection too much, I think lucka is the kind of person that needs a more low grade relationship, she's not the person to make out in public, she's not the person to forgo opportunities when relationship is at stake, which is just...a dissonance of priorities I suppose and that's perfectly fine, that happens, but...ondra has been taking this breakup very badly, he liked her so much, maybe even <i>too <\/i>much but you know I can sympathise to a boy liking a girl very much and it just being unrequited...my last vacation be like 😬<br><br>but yeah, lucka found two different boys mere days after breaking up, with one of them she slept in bed and caused him to break up with his girl, then she started trash talking him and now is getting together with a different boy who is your most typical beach boy who must be quite dumb not going to lie, she invited him over to Hracholusky and even though she argues it was honza, I do think she really wanted him there ergo honza just said what she really wanted someone else to say.. basically dressed up very provocatively and that was all there was to it, which I find just a liiiiittle bit odd 😶‍🌫️<br><br>then štěpán just fetched us for a brief leg and we walked, I was very tired and especially the temperature was really really high which I wasn't too appreciative of 😑 didn't have enough water on me hence I was incredibly thirsty for cold and refreshing beverage, anyways we walked and walked and honza shared some stuff that started oddly sounding like depression, he even sort of self diagnosed it and even though I am not very well familiar with these kinds of depressive disorders, I do suppose it does sound like one and I'm not very sure as to what to do with that<br><br>he was in cyprus just a week ago and following our last visit at the airport and team building, he was rejected by saša which took him by a hit and I suppose I wasn't too empathetic because he just...seemed to put far too much into something so young and it just didn't seem that realistic anyways given she was not exactly the kind of person <i>I <\/i>would like, stella found her very much not sympathic while štěpán and lucka found her adorable, which is...kinda odd, given her behaviour, I think I found her okay but given how she treated the food I was left slightly bewildered as to her upbringing 🧐<br><br>anyways at chalupa we largely rested and made some amazing photographs using my digital camera, set up honza's secret and honza was a little too inquisitive about the sex situation between me and stella to which I was quite enigmatic because hell I don't want to overshare <i>again<\/i>&nbsp;gosh, we talked till far too late but hey I responded to stella and the golden hour walk back was quite marvellous 🌞<br><br>in my mind there was a deep sense of gratitude for having been brought up in such a beautiful country that is czechia 🇨🇿 but I did still feel some insecurity given everything in my life, especially stella, don't know why, all feels somewhat hazy, I also found out we're going to cyprus 🇨🇾 on saturday which I'm not enthusiastic about because CO2 and stuff but hey, if that needs to exist 🫤 a nice day, a lot of oranges I see, but don't confuse that for happiness, it's just a lot of very special occasions nowadays (although the morning was very

and caught the train and put the rose into my water bottle as to make sure that it doesn't dry out ☔<br><br>so having arrived there I felt surprisingly nervous given she actually <i>was <\/i>already my girlfriend but yeah walking through the station with that rose in my hand yeah it was a feeling 🥀 then some guy walked up to me and tried to convince me to give him money for the train which I did because he seemed surprisingly legitimate because he was actually my age 😮‍💨 don't know what to think about that...<br><br>then stella came 💗 she looked again like she was making it deliberately difficult for me to even recognise her hah but I did and gave her the rose and she seemed very happy... the way she is, she didn't say too much because she seldom does, communication is sort of an issue I think for both of us, but she hugged me and kissed me and held my hand and was in general just so adorable to me that I had no doubt that I made the right call by buying the rose...🌹<br><br>we took the xC bus which is basically replacement for the currently not operating metro and yeah the conversation was a tad too shallow with me basically just looking around but that was okay and we

indeed...<br><br>then stella went home because she needed to put the rose in the vase so I waited outside and it was only ex post facto that she told me that her mum was there and seemed just sooo happy for her which made my day 🙂‍↕️ we walked through modřany and all the forests there to stella's dad villa and I was extremely thirsty because guess what the weather has been getting surprisingly reasonable since wednesday 🍀<br><br>there we...well stella first ate her baguette and I slept on her shoulder and then we made out on the couch and yeah came dangerously close to having actually sex ✨ but that's okay, I didn't really want that to happen because I think we need just a little more time, but it was a lovely time, and honestly...there was that moment where I really wanted to tell stella \"<i>hey you, I like you<\/i>\" and it was amidst us making out that it took me a fair two minutes to finally make up my mind and tell her...and she responded <i>I like you too<\/i>, so all was well ❤️‍🩹 we just lay there and I don't even know how but stella said my hair looked golden in this golden hour sunshine and that I look like the petit prince which was the book she did her maturita in 🧚‍♂️<br><br>good time, I do think we needn't have come so intimately close but it was ultimately okay and neither of us seemed too upset over it 👉👈 lastly we had to take the bus and try our goddamn

surplus making me quite happy 😊.<br><br>two things today, stella and all the rest.<br><br>first stella, I do deeply appreciate that she actually cares, she's so cute, and so pretty too, just remember sunday...but most importantly, no filtering, she gets all of it, and she cares so much ❤️‍🩹 what a lovely girl, and today a very important difference to autumn dawned on me, I actually like her as a person, not as a mere idea, markéta was cute not because I'd actually know her and she'd actually understand me, but merely because I idealised her, there were no deep philosophical meanings behind her words, I really liked her bittersweet flavour of life, but the stark contrast between how I felt and what i could tell her...let that never happen again, it was a mayfly, and a good one, in time of need, but not a one that could actually sustain anything, that's why stella feels so substantially different ✨<br><br>some things I appreciate about her, in an utterly random order so please no judgement&nbsp;<br><ul><li>she's so goddamn cute saying those diminutive vulgar forms like jejdamane and ajtakrajta ✨<\/li><li>when she's got contacts, she can look like literally she most smash person in prague, it's unbelievable ✨<\/li><li>me and her actually have a really calm vibe to us, when we need to, that wednesday will remain one of the most cherished memories for me, just because of how <i>calm <\/i>it was ✨<\/li><li>she's so goddamn clever, she knew what s&amp;p500 was, the correct form of parasympatheticus...so much more, so many little things ✨<\/li><li>she's so calm, she's untouchable, got her peace and quiet and she's not to be bothered, I appreciate that very much ✨<\/li><li>she actually cares about me and wants to see me and is appalled at the idea of me even thinking I might be bothering her ✨<\/li><li>she's from a humble background and it shows in her appreciation for the world ✨<\/li><li>she's got experience dealing with complex medical states with her sister and in general she's got a lot of respect and good relationships with her siblings, which is a genuine green flag ✨<\/li><li>she's not pretentious at all, she can be not too expressive, but you can sense if something's wrong ✨<\/li><li>she's got absolutely beautiful eyes and hair✨<\/li><li>she's just the right height for us to look really good together not gonna lie ✨<\/li><li>she's quite expressive when it comes to affection and that just soothes my soul ✨<\/li><li>I think she'll have time for me even in the future, I think she's ready to build from here

I found that strange, because you'd think she'd <i>at least <\/i>go on to put it into the rubbish bin, but even then it's food waste...?<br><br>anyways we went for a hike where vojta took us in his car and then we walked in a very beautiful alleyway with špendlíky, which is a special kind of plums all around us, very cute looking, it was cloudy around us with little beams of sunshine ☁️ honza walked with us in the back because he was somewhat unsure as to whether and how he should talk to saša, and once me and stella figured we were far enough from everyone but honza we just held hands, of course we did 🥰<br><br>honza then went to saša, and however tired we were we just looked at them all in the front and talked about them, and about me and stella too, it was the exact kind of effortless conversation that's funny enough and just so pleasant, comfy 🫶 the hike was really nice, there were some interesting observations&nbsp;<br><ul><li>when honza stopped over to tie his laces or something, saša continued on with štěpán not really caring which seemed somewhat odd 🤔<\/li><li>štěpán always walked by them and we made fun of them that they are two couples because štěpán always has his non-alcoholic beer by 😆<\/li><li>vojta has a job in eli and I was completely blown away by that and moreso, when I said I find it seriously impressive compared to saša because he's self-built, he corrected me that he's very privileged, lucky and definitely not self-built, which is the exact kind of humbleness this world needs and I find it just wonderful 🥺<\/li><\/ul>stella had to pause because he foot was aching, I tried to help her all I could, with my <i>comfort <\/i>napkins which was very funny 🤣 everybody knew we were together, at least somewhat, but stella still refrained from holding hands in front of all of them which is understandable and made for some mildly funny encounters 😆<br><br>the cloudy strata broke down somewhat and sun poured down on us earthlings, making for a beautiful change of scenery in this really wonderful flatland of northern bohemia, I was constantly stunned at the amount of fruit, lush greenery and really calm and magnificent buildings around us ✨<br><br>we hopped into the car and parted with vojta et al, which was not nice, we did hug because damn he's a great person completely 🖖 and saša left her food in our car which made for an encounter where we tried to give it back to us, honza was mildly exciting that he was going to see her once again, but she just said no, štepan got his camera back and then they just drove on which made honza sad and all of us slightly perplexed because it's such and odd behaviour 🤔<br><br>and the drive was so cute, stella didn't really want to be too obvious, but we did sit in the back next to one another and did hold hands and she just so gracefully stroked mine and I hers it was really so marvellous 😇 honza didn't feel very nice because it aggravated his feeling of failing again, given me and stella made it so far so fast...lucky.&nbsp;<br><br>we went from some city northeast of my future hometown to the airport and the sequence was as follows, the so wonderful thing is almost feels orchestrated 🙂‍↕️<br><ul><li>first stella was worried about holding hands because štěpán and eda were there but they were so focused on the drive that they didn't check on us at all ☕<\/li><li>we drove past the views of prague and I noted that the motorways are enormous to which stella said she doesn't understand it either but seeing this city that's soon enough going to be the one I will call mine was surreal<\/li><li>my friends all around me felt wonderful and honza gradually texted me about how sad he feels and I was trying to do my best to make him feel better and we agreed we'd go to the airport because I needed to fetch my things and the airport would very much cheer honza up ✨<\/li><li>as we drove down prague we saw the proton therapy centre which is owned by saša's uncles and honza noted that it's the sad kind of exploiting sick people capitalism which he was right about and made us all collectively mourn 😞<\/li><li>then we were down the tunnels were nobody saw us so we held hands very relationship-ey and just had a truly marvellous time there kind of cuddling there 🥰<\/li><li>we drove past the fyzikální ústav in northwest prague in this villaesque part of the city which made me reminisce last august when we were there and simultaneously think about my possible futures there ✨<\/li><\/ul>on we went down evropská street and štěpán played 🎶 kids by mgmt and it went like<br><br><i>me: damn I love this, I've been listening to this song so much the past weeks I love it so damn much<\/i><br><i>stella: *looks at me very conspicuously and quite surprised*<\/i><br><i>stella: me too, I've been listening to this so goddamn much<\/i><br><i>me: I figured, you listen to empire of the sun so much I thought you'd love this too<\/i><br><i>me: I don't recall what-who sings it&nbsp;<\/i><br><i>stella: it's kids I think<\/i><br><i>me: yeah but the artist it's...those four letters<\/i><br><br><i>🎶 enjoy yourself, take only what you need from me, a family of trees<\/i><br><br>lastly the picture of driving through the very green parts of prague that don't even feel like they're prague seeing stepan and eda and all of the people I love and feeling so marvellous being there ✨<br><br>we arrived at the airport and had a really long time finding a parking spot but eventually succeeded, then walked, me and stella didn't hold hands but continued to the cafeteria, stella was never at the airport itself, she seemed impressed but not as much as honza, as nobody is as impressed as honza 🙈<br><br>we had lunch, sitting there, I sat opposite stella, honza was talking about saša and how marvellous she is and constantly was nudging everyone to agree saying \"I mean she's so rich but she's down to earth like all of us RIGHT????\" and looked at stella and said \"shush you\" and me and stella said in perfect sync<br><br><i>me: stella didn't say anything!!!<\/i><br><i>stella:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn't say anything!!!<\/i><br><br>cute times, we had an airbus a380 behind us which just underlined the seriously impressive mood that we had there, with that really good and tasty meal too, as we all needed 🫶 I went to the toilet with štěpán and we had some good chats too, I like štěpán, stella told me that she was inquisitive about what he thought about me too, and allegedly he said that I'm a kind person but have my tempers, which I agree with definitely 😆<br><br>we took a picture in front of the A380 because we wanted to make honza happy and I didn't even make a fuzz about him telling us to all smile even if we didn't really feel like it and him making that silly silly same expression on every goddamn photo 😆<br><br>we went on and I walked with honza to get my luggage from the deposit place and we went alone because he really thought I was going to give him some food advice, which I failed to because I had honestly told him all that I had to say 😅 fascinating...got my bag which was a little too expensive and then...picture...<br><br>us walking up that very international place that is the airport that I have associated with the most fun and most monumental trips of my life and just seeing those huge empty fields for the planes on that cloudy day feeling so significant and then we walked to that little little white car of eda's and I opened the car and got my backs and transferred my stuff from one to another and then asked stella if we can leave from here and we hugged everyone including štěpán and eda and I just felt so in community with all of them and so deeply grateful for all the time we've shared ✨<br><br>I took stella's hand as we left my friends behind as they were headed to pilsen with all my bags with them, we found the bus to zličín and sat there and talked<br><ul><li>she explained to me honza has asked her if she wanted to sleep next to me that last night and that she would habe said yes but was unsure because she didn't know if honza knew all that had happened leading up to that point ✨<\/li><li>we talked about how sad honza was this last day and I said that it's like dealing with a kid, airports are what makes him happy and cheer him up so I said I had to try my best to cheer him up, I referenced my brother whom we used to always take to the train station in instances like these<\/li><\/ul><div>we then walked down to the metro station and stella put a lot of thought into which part of the car we should get into so that we're the closest to the staircase in our destination station 😆 I found that very nerdy and fun because we literally had nowhere to rush to<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>in the metro we leaned onto the doors even though it's prohibited everyone does it and we held hands and I just felt very calm and peaceful as I always do when I'm with her 🥺<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>we arrived at the station one further that we planned because even though it was about 14.30 and my bus could leave at 15.30, stella said I should go with the later one at 17.30 and we will stay in the city until then 🫶 I found that cute because she wanted to spend time with me even though she had already spent the last 48 hours with me almost completely ✨<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>we arrived and walked up these stairs and I proposed to take her bag which she agreed and we found a bench to sit on just as it started raining so we moved a bit under some tree and used my umbrella ☔&nbsp;<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>there we kissed and talked like 50\/50 of the time and it felt so goddamn marvellous 🙂‍↕️ we had to move because some sketchy people started arguing right behind the fence behind us, but even then we just made out and discussed the events of the past days 🫶<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>it was so cute, it wasn't <i>perfect<\/i>, because at this age I'm old enough to know that perfection isn't what we should strive for, I still saw some of the ghosts of younger me and fears I still hold, sometimes, that it doesn't feel right, that it doesn't whatever, but at that moment it all just went <i>silent <\/i>and I put my arms around the waist of this person I just very suddenly came to love as she stroked my hand and smiled looking at me ✨<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>we talked about how fast and effortlessly it all came about, about how shocked we both are that this came to be, and the three hours we spent there were gone in an instant, as time always is with her, the incredibly comfy person that she is 🥰<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>she showed me some pictures with her siblings, talked about her relationship with her family, parents, and talked about her life, what happened to her, how she feels...she's very kind ✨<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>we walked down to the bus station with my groin\/testicle region very sore because <i>EHM-EHM-reasons <\/i>because hell yeah I like her this way too and as we arrived at the station I put my bags where I ought to and walked up to her and said<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><i>I hope to see you very soon again<\/i><\/div><div><i>stella: me too, very much, thank you for all<\/i><\/div><div><i><br><\/i><\/div><div>and on that note we kissed

I woke up to the sounds of honza and everyone around me being really upset with me and stella, I didn't really want to have to open my eyes to them because I knew they would be mean, I knew I had to apologise but didn't really want to until we could have an adult discussion about it<br><br>I opened my eyes and put my eyemask off, only to tell them that no, it's not necessary that they wait for us and very quickly and with a sigh of relief I heard them leave in one car for the trip I was too tired to take 🫡<br><br>I saw stella in the bed next to mine, she was under her blanket, in her sweatshirt, I wished her a good morning and she got up and put her phone on the charger, I was a little bit surprised that she wanted to stay here with me instead of leaving with them for the trip, but didn't ask her or anything, maybe because I wasn't confident enough talking to her yet at this point<br><br>she sat on a chair next to my bed as I was laid down in my pyjamas, we talked about what they told her before I woke up and she seemed mildly unhappy with saša's behaviour who was acting mean not out of frustration that ultimately stems from compassion and care but for no reason at all, as she wasn't the one affected by our leaving for the communal room<br><br>I looked at stella and as she seemed very tired I suggested she lay next to me onto honza's bed and we just rest... honestly I don't even know what was happening for these four hours of ours just being alone in the room\/hut\/chalet but I sure do know I felt very comfortable and very nice ✨<br><br>we eventually got up after 5 hours and went on to heat up my lunch, we returned to the hut and I cleaned the table so we could sit there as two humans and not animals 🗣️ it was very very nice, I cleaned the whole room as stella ate her rice cakes with hummus or something&nbsp;<br><br>we lay back onto the bed, I was very happy with the pristine state of the room that I managed to bring about, very very happy, I told stella to come back to bed with me and she locked the room because she knew honza would be upset again had he come to see us in his bed and we knew this day was not the day to make him upset furthermore 😅<br><br>I slept so little on that day, but felt so okay, shockingly okay, I looked at stella who was barely 30cm away from me and I kind of held her hand as she was very cold and said so, I didn't really trust this whole enterprise enough to truly be sure that we're in the destination yet, but I sure knew we were going somewhere, she looks at me, I do think she wants me to kiss her but I'm not sure enough yet so I just lay next to her and we talk, she doesn't seem upset, she doesn't have her glasses and her hair is loose, she looks really pretty, I think to myself<br><br>stella<i>: honza říkal že jsi jako on akorát starší, to se mi moc nezdá, on je tak hlučnej, obzvlášť spolu jsou všichni tak hlučný, už hodnekrat jsem cítila jako že jim vynadam<\/i><br>me<i>: asi jsem klidnější nez honza, myslím že mám min potřebu na všechno tlačit, ale nevim<\/i><br>stella: <i>úplně cítím jak se netěším až uslyším to auto přijíždět, teď je to tak hezky, tak klidně, jsem ráda že jsem tu zůstala&nbsp;<\/i><br>me: <i>jsem taky rád že jsi tu zůstala&lt;33<\/i><br><br>so we just lay there and wait the last minutes that we can, time slows down to a halt, for a moment everything feels so at peace, I feel so comfortable, I feel I like her very much, I realise I really like the way I feel when I'm with her, that my body is not screaming, which is so so rare<br><br>then we hear them and the first thing honza tells us as stella is unlocking the door for him is <i>potřebujete soukromí??? máme jít pryč zase??? <\/i>in a passive aggressive style that honza is so known for&nbsp;<br><br>we walk out and I ask vojta for his knife so that I cut the potatoes as stella washes them for me and we both know that we're <i>something <\/i>now even if it's not perfectly defined yet, it's about 6pm as I finish my crockpot for the day and honza really wants to talk to me<br><br>we go outside and walk on the side of the road, some kilometre away from the campsite itself, he first asks me about my

exactly what it says on the tin, <i>leaving the whole goddamn world behind, <\/i>yes maybe with all its sorrow and trauma and trouble, but also with it warmth and trust and hope and memories that maybe weren't all that sad...mainly it means leaving friends, and some friends are just too goddamn good to be left behind...that was my reasoning back when I claimed I'd study in pilsen, what a lie to myself that was, and leaving the world behind was the reasoning that gave me the glimpse of brno... but yeah, somewhere along the middle we shall dwell...the golden middle way 🤝 compromise without <i>compromiso<\/i>, not even a compromise, compromise doesn't necessarily means all sides are best off, but here I really do believe they are...<\/li><li>and lastly, my health, even though it has been really good recently, like I don't even realise how fucking impressive is that I have a full time job without it wrecking me, let alone the fact that I travelled right around europe without <i>any negative consequences <\/i>🥰 just let that sink in....but yeah basically, even yesterday I <i>sensed <\/i>the malaise like back in winter and it was a good reminder that even though adversity might be good, life ought not to be <i>just <\/i>about survival 🐦<\/li><\/ul>anyways stella sent us <i>both <\/i>a video of a guy making out with a fucking pole so we didn't know what to think about it but she seems to have had a good time so I'm happy for her 🫶 and on that note we went to the swimming pool where yeah I swam but I didn't feel so much like it because the whole nervousness about my future living accomodations was killing me!!<br><br>we came back but my uncle wasn't picking up the phone so okay we went to the fair again where there were honza's and lucka's classmates so we waved at them even though honza claimed that that was absolutely unsolicited but goddamn I don't care 💅 <br><br>and okay on we went but then <i>at last <\/i>my uncle picked up my phone and it was surreal walking uphill, that hill where we walked up a year ago, back when I was still in a relationship with anežka, back when I thought I was finally coming to rest with my illness, wrecked by epstein–barr and yet with such a long journey ahead of me, I didn't even know...with the sun kind of glazing its last rays as golden hour settles and the lush aestival forests of this rural area I visit seldom because it's just so goddamn hard to get into and as I walk that steep hill up biting my nails hoping that at last I convince him that <i>hey that apartment lays there empty...I know you've been through a lot, but it ain't much that I need <\/i>and to that came a hesitant, because his girlfriend died living there and the memory is probably somewhat heavy, with his father, my grandfather having passed away mere weeks ago, because of all the weight that comed along...but a <i>yes<\/i> nonetheless.<br><br>we agreed 🤝 for the first semester, I'm free to live in his empty apartment in uhříněves, just to see it all, and with all going well, I do think we may as well prolong it until the end of first year and then I'd <i>love <\/i>to go on to CERN or some Erasmus+ place because damn that would be great&nbsp;<br><br>so the best of all worlds I suppose, no rental agreement, no commitments, close to home (3h9min total travel time compared to Brno's 5h40min total travel time), and my very own living under my very own conditions and <i>damn<\/i>, let's do it&nbsp;<br><br>in the evening we shared a nice walk and had some talks even though honestly malaise crept in more than I had hoped 🙈 just a sign that <i>maybeeee <\/i>it's not so over, just a subtle reminder that I've made the right call, yes it's summer now and yes it's better than a year ago but the fog may thicken again and it's only mature to be bracing for impact rather than naively daydreaming about a version of me that might just not be ripe yet...✨<br><br>and the evening chats were actually kind of pretty, because I texted stella in the evening that I was very nervous given my accomodation situation and all she responded with was <i>\"have you sorted it out somewhat? at least a little? 🥺<\/i>\" and that was exactly what I needed to hear. she just cared. honza says that her ex-boyfriend who is a not-so-reputable existence says she was dismissive and not serious when he deemed she should have been, and that she kind of curveballs the conversation someplace less grave when she feels like it, but damn have I never felt that from her. I poured kind of <i>all <\/i>my trauma out for her and she not only respected and cared, she <i>understood<\/i>, only lucka has even understood this in my life but she went as far as to <i>be helpful. <\/i>how marvellous, and no, she has never been anything but nice to me, yet, so maybe I don't see what's yet to come but damn have I come to trust her very much even before anything concrete came along 🙈<br><br>it's kind of odd, it feels sublime, for now, I trust her and find her very nice, but we're yet to see if all the other checks come along too...but hey, no harm in fooling around and finding out...<i> laissez-faire, <\/i>afterall.<br><br>I find it funny that back in august 2022 we went to ŘEŽ which is a nuclear physics research institute and it was there that I realised I want to pursue science and the lady told us all <i>hey go study material science, there's never enough material scientists for us...<\/i>&nbsp;and it's just a hilarious detail that that is indeed what I am bound to study, even if finishing it is in the stars for now...and what a journey it took to come to the years old conclusion...studying physics in chemnitz, bioinformatics in prague, physics in pilsen, something in brno and lastly...hopefully...material physics in prague, what a ride...yes the outcome might be the same but it damn sure it about the process<br><br>and yeah, liminal phase, with so many unsettled things, but at least I'm facing it reasonably safe and sound, rather than breaking beneath the weight ✨<br><br>somewhere between home and otherness, just like the lilt of the lady from czechs afar, so does my future seem foreign and familiar at the same time, beautiful but subtly dissonant 🫶","note_title":"somewhere between gatwick and heathrow","tags":[1155,1190,1226,1166,1227,1203,1168,1170],"assets":[498],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29327,"minute":3,"hour":19,"day":25,"month":6,"year":2025,"datetime":1753462981055,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"so yeah I mean the day is wonderful BUT david pop texted me that he's got the apartment in brno ready but for some reason I really don't feel like leaving the world behind 🥺<br><br>but my uncle isn't picking my phone up so I don't know what we'll do","note_title":"","tags":[1153],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29328,"minute":12,"hour":10,"day":25,"month":6,"year":2025,"datetime":1753431132477,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"aight so today I've had to wake up very early because today was my visit at psychiatry 💅 I got up around 7.30 and really did think that it would be the end of me because this morning was extremely challenging indeed <br><br>quickly made some porridge and tested far too much on all those modes of transit...❤️‍🩹 but at least at the psychiatrist it was halfway decent and we've decided to fade out amitriptyline for the time being...well we'll see where the path will go, what a strange path, I felt some subtle nausea today riding those buses and the sore throat is annoying sometimes still....truly a multipolar world I find myself in right now, better than winter though","note_title":"","tags":[],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29329,"minute":43,"hour":22,"day":24,"month":6,"year":2025,"datetime":1753389785453,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"so for my intents and purposes today was a day that I will probably neither remember especially well nor would I want it to forget ✨ it did have that scent of last year's with the malaise sometimes getting dangerously close and the sore throat persisting somewhat, even if it was decoupled from the usual depressions that tend to come along 🙂‍↕️<br><br>I woke up around 8.30 and had chicken for breakfast because I was very hungry in the evening 😙 then went to the bus and walked right past markéta's home...and it is noteworthy, because the time difference between november 22nd and april 4th is 133 days and between april 15th and july 24th is 100 days...<br><br>but gosh when I walked past in april it felt so short, it didn't feel far at all!

got to write stuff down honestly because I have been so bad at it recently, I tried putting in the events of last sunday but gosh I can't even be frank with myself so let's just be very very frank because this is my diary and mine only!!✨<br><br>having arrived in prague I sensed...there is a sense of oddness to meeting somebody you never <i>actually saw<\/i>&nbsp;and sure there are guarantees like she's not some horrific person because we know most people by commonness but nonetheless...it was odd<br><br>having stood there at vyšehrad I felt very odd, on one hand, she was a lovely person to talk to and that truly was something!! on the other hand she gave off the kind of anička krebsová vibe where yes she's lovely but she's a <i>friend <\/i>and barely a romantic interest, and standing there I was wrestling with the thought of being out with somebody I don't just dogmatically <i>like&nbsp;<\/i><br><br>we did spend a lot of time together and I think the tide started changing right about near the prague castle, where she tried to guess what language the people there were speaking and I corrected judged it being Portuguese with that leading to me explaining syllable-timed and stress-timed languages which was hilarious 🦅<br><br>coincidentally there also was idea 9 played as we walked down from the castle which was just fascinating, making me reminisce of all the times I had with that song over the past year, for there were many<br><br>we sat down near the wenceslas square on some benches and she explained greek drama to me which led to me asking \"<i>well this was lovely, but how did we get to it in the first place?<\/i>\" to wit the answer was we actually didn't know, a good sign indeed&nbsp;<br><br>as we walked towards the train station the vibes were good, it still felt foreign to think that this could lead to anything romantic, however it felt so much more comfortable that at the beginning and the truth is that by the end...<i>I didn't really know<br><\/i><br>you probably do remember in april when I attempted to get back with markéta and you <i>just <\/i>couldn't make the feelings come back, that fluffy fuzzy warm infatuation that I used to sense in november, oh how intense it was back then!!! and for no reason at all! I guess the anticipation made it all feel so..<i> intense&nbsp;<br><\/i><br>but do mind that back then it had its issues, yes I was obsessed with her but the truth was...I wasn't well and she was <i>not <\/i>a person I could tell, which is probably the most important thing in a relationship, right? I was breaking down every sunday like it were a routine (🎶 <i>cause there'll be no sun on sunday<\/i>) and she was not the person to know, not because she wouldn't respect and lament that, she probably would, but because she wouldn't understand and hence, sadly, probably couldn't help either&nbsp;<br><br>on the other hand, stella being the same age as I am just has those life experiences that we all gather like pokémons, turns out her sister suffered and still somewhat does from a condition eerily similar to mine, chronic laryngopharyngeal discomfort, and the thing is, that the most influential experiences are the first hand ones, but even second hand ones impact us greatly and she sure is a person I can trust to understand, not only she already did, I entrusted her with it, confided, which is substantial in and of itself&nbsp;<br><br>now the only question remains, with most compatibility things going really well, us having tons to talk about, trusting each other and

programming, dad's TV show being just a little bit too sexual and lastly lingering for just a little too long awake<br><br>a-a-anyways something much more interesting has been going on for the past literally 2 days that I do sense an obligation to tell y'all about 💅 so before I left for discovereu honza said there's this girl stella who hé sais is interested primarily in him allegedly but he said we'd make a great couple<br><br>I responses with gosh I'm leaving for a month no way I'm getting messy now because it's either an ephimera or worse, I end up texting my whole discoverEU experience trying to keep the spark sparking in turn making me glued to my phone 📱 so that was a no at that time <br><br>but yesterday we found ourselves in the bus and Honza was texting her something and so I thought hmmm what an interesting person I took his phone and texted with her back and forth somewhat and gosh it made for such a fun conversation and she was so wonderfully unhinged ❤️‍🩹<br><br>honza gave me her phone number and I thought to myself that it's just a little bit too much but then I said screw it and went ahead and gosh it's been going on ever since and I can actually sense that it's mutual even though I absolutely don't understand how ✨<br><br>she's older than me by a month but honestly seems younger than me at least by looks, she's wonderfully unhinged just as I am to my close friend when I'm really...in the mood, she's honestly approachable and much easier to talk to than all the people I spent many month with last time (however adorable they were) and she's just so lovely that it progresses so quickly 🫂<br><br>lucka told me not to delay things too much and so cutishly i texted her if she wants to go out and it got a little bit messy but ultimately just a few hours in we seem to be on a darn good trajectory

where exactly do you live??\" \"by the ponds\" \"I WALK MY DOG THERE\" I was just excited for no reason whatsoever, I was so excited I texted her that I go walk my dog there...anyways the day comes the weather is cold and bad even though it's literally June and I come to the house not thinking too much and they open the door and the lady is lovely and in comes her daughter and yes for me it was a plot twist that she is the girl from the bus and from the school but simultaneously she's 2 years younger than filip suggested (or so I assume because she's two classes lower than expected) and okay so I don't think too much about it, I just greeted her and said that i remember her well she remembers me too but so do most people from school, okay so I tutor her for...a long time, and she's really clever really no idea why she thinks she needs tutoring, like I'm good at math so I do my best and then her mum literally asks me if I want soup and I'm like \"oh I don't want to be a bother\" and she insists so I have a soup with them and then spaghetti too and okay so I tutor her and there are some problems even I just don't know because my ingenuity is not limitless and we just sit there and stare at it and we're like lost but yeah eventually I figure it all out even though it's planimetrics which I just really don't like 🫣 oddly I notice she's weirdly dermatographic and actually wonder if I should ask her if she's okay because she has horrible scratches all over her shoulders but then it disappears fast so I infer she's just dermatographic and perfectly fine otherwise...and damn okay there is something about sitting together for 4 stupid hours literally like 40 cm apart, and there is something about girls doing that flipping thing with their hair to put it behind their ears...I don't know I'm not great at inferring signals but I've erred with younger girls far too many times to just not notice 💀💀 with lenka my not noticing didn't really work out very well did it 💀💀💀 also she has that stupidly smash tight gray fit but gosh stop it this is so weird she's younger than my brother I suppose anyways... okay so her parents are absolute gigachads and then her friend comes because we totally overdo it but she sends her to her room and I ask her if she really wants to just finish math instead of hanging out with her friend to which she responds very directly and we finish the math and then I just tell her to go to her friend and clean it all by myself because gosh I felt terrible it's just math bruh 💀💀 her parents just bid farewell to me the absolute gigachad way they are knowing about all my future and all the stuff I've told them over the bowl of spaghetti they had given me and I walk home....and I wonder, this was so good why the fuck did I linger there for four hours 😪 and it felt like an instant...idk maybe it was just people being really really nice to me but mate that's so stupid...and tomorrow I need to go to the city and I can either be reasonable and take the earlier direct bus OR I can take the later bus and overcomplicate my life and just hope she takes it too (she does though) and ask her how her exam went 💀💀 I know this is literally headed nowhere because I'm just delusional from people treating me nice but anyways a funsie lol<\/i><br><br>to which chat went<br><br><i>Life advice, then?<br>Take the damn earlier bus unless you're clear-eyed and calm about seeing her.

knew full well we aren't saving this with that<br><br>I walked into the room to do the maths and got some number and it was binomická věta and faktoriál which was just brilliant, I knew exactly what to do, I did it and all the math worked out absolutely stunning, quadratics correct and so by the board we just had a laugh and really a good time 💅 I loved the fun with Mrs. Wintrová and Korčáková and just in general, exactly the good vibes I had hoped for ✨ yes maybe I was a little lucky to get such a simple topic but gosh! yesss<br><br>walked back and rehearsed for literature, I walked in

know – what noetic means and that he wrote the piece <i>Matka<\/i>&nbsp;which I just failed to remember so spectacularly, thankfully the more ordinary questions like útvar and postup i completely

moved that there were certainly subjects that I in there thinking honestly, I was a little bit worried because I knew that there were certainly subjects that I hadn't rehearsed enough 😔 but okay so I picked the number and I got electric current in materials so I knew I had to figure out gas discharges, conduction in solid state. I also had to do electrolysis and galvanic batteries and lastly semiconductors and transistors ⚡&nbsp;<br><br>okay so I did the electrolysis example and I was a little bit confused that I got 64 g of copper per 1 g of hydrogen 😬 but it turned out it was correct and I managed to get all of that right. Then I started talking and one of the things I didn't get exactly correct was, for example how the magnetic field influences the beam of electrons in the cathode Ray tube 😅 and then I failed to do dimension analysis to figure out the value of faraday constant but overall and then at the end I also forgot to show them. The diodes as the example and there was an LED and I managed to show that but it wasn't brilliant and so I knew I had a bit between A and B<br><br>Then we walked upstairs and waited and then we got the results and I go straight A's which was honestly surprising 😅 because I definitely thought that the literature wasn't good enough to get an a 😅 okay so then we stayed in the school for a bit to talk with the teachers and eventually we going to have lunch in an Indian restaurant with my friends Vojta, Monika, Eda, Kiki and Ondra 💞 and we just really had a great time and it was fun and around 3:00 p.m. I headed back home where I laid back a bit and rested and then we had a celebration with my family in the city&nbsp;<br><br>I actually had quite a pleasant ride with my brother 😄 but then at the dinner I got quite a decadent feeling because it was a ludicrously expensive place and my parents they just play being so rich and I really dislike that 😔 so we were there for a bit with my grandparents and I didn't eat much because I had eaten too much and I had a bit of a stomach ache so I just chipped here and there and it was a pleasant enough time until everybody started talking about politics which has been a very fiery subject 🫣<br><br>so I eventually got up and decided that I would walk back home instead of taking the bus with everybody because I was feeling like I needed to have some time to process everything in my head because it certainly hasn't been an easy day 🥺 and the walk was kind of magical ✨<br><ul><li>at first I just walked along there ever and recorded a voice memo.

That things were turning for the better, but it was still hard time fall 2024. It was maybe the first time that I already understood that this was a longer journey than I was hoping for was maybe the first time that I wasn't stuck in a delusion believing that everything would resolve magically that everything would just go away. It was perhaps the first time that I actually tried to live in the present other than deny it or try to skip it or anything. It was perhaps the first time that I had to actually learn to weather this storm and just. Yeah it took me awhile. It was the first time that I wasn't delusional about believing something that it wasn't. And it was at this time. This absurdly difficult time for me when I met her. It was such a funny coincidence. I couldn't go to the final prom training for dancing because I just chose not to because my body wasn't feeling it and I was going to buy some frozen strawberries in Tesco because they only have them in Tesco and I was. I put headphones on and I went to the tram stop and I had a really bad mood that day because it was sad for me that all my friends were going to dance and I wasn't. And I stood there and I saw my friend lucka there with some other girl and I was looking at the ground but they came to me and lucka pinched me in my shoulder and they started talking to me and of course I talked to them back. And I went with them and then lucka went for the bus and I was left there with a girl and I. I remember that I asked her what her name was and I just couldn't have known how important that would become. She knew me she at least because well lucka told her I I hadn't known her and I waited until her tram came and I waved at her. And I just in the meantime did my best to be kind of kind I asked her some small talk and I wondered a little bit. And then I walked to Tesco and I thought to myself damn she was nice and she was really pretty. And I also thoughts to myself. She must have been so much younger than me. And that I kind of quietly had a crush on her for month maybe two. It was and it was so so mutual and I was completely bewilded at it being so mutual. And we spent the month in autumn together. Kind of situationship style. We went out twice during that time and I accompanied her home a few times and we've been dancing once and it was so wonderful. I bought her a rose because I thought that was going to be nice and I did so and I gave her the rose and I remember she was. She has these eyes very blue and honestly very similar to me and it was one of the things that she said the month prior to lucka that it was something about my eyes. And I remember her eyes when I gave her the rose. She was so surprised and she was. It felt really warm. And we danced together and I felt really cute like. And I accompanied her home and we talked about some silly things and I remember I stood in front of her house. And then we hugged before we parted ways and I felt so close to her and I asked her if I may kiss her and she said so. As I did and then we parted and I walked for my bus I felt so confused cuz it was wonderful and I've but I felt the confusion that she felt as well. And then two days later we sat on a bench and she told me that she's incredibly grateful for having met me that she doesn't think that we should get together because well, I should learn from my exams and would we would get hurt a lot. We would get hurt a lot if it wouldn't work out cuz we really really fell for one another. And it wasn't that we couldn't get along or anything. It just she felt like she wasn't ready and I was only there to respect it. And I just couldn't forget her. I read the master and margarita and I just filled that's who she is kind of. And I couldn't forget her for months. I couldn't forget her because she was just so cute and so lovely. And even if it was infatuation at the beginning at the end, I really liked her for who she was not for who I thought she was. She was that quiet private introvert who read so many books who went on so many walks. Who valued solitude who had to endure some tough stuff in life? Who was someone stoic and some what cynical. Who was very kind to me but also not naive to the world around. She was the only person with whom I already felt that she felt the same way for me as I felt for her. She was that beautiful. Very pretty. Maybe a bit too young. Wonderful human being who I just happened to have met. And for months I couldn't forget her and then it was maybe a bit of a hail Mary because I don't know she would put these Latin notes on her Instagram and knowing that I'm like the only person who speaks Latin around her. So sometimes I text to her and we chatted for a bit but I understood that she needed distance even though she felt probably still the same way that I did. And I thought to myself that this feels like a book like a novel that I made a girl who's a great friend of my great friend who's kind and beautiful and just so lovely. Whose name the same way as the main protagonist of the master and margarita. A book in which there's a plot that takes place in the ancient Rome, which is the empire whose language both her and I speak. That just feels like a novel. It feels it feels so detailed to just be coincidence. To just be to left. Those two weeks ago. I texted her. And we chatted and then I saw her walk home and I was walking on the other side of the street and I was listening to brightside by the lumineers I was listening to the never really mine by the lumineers. I I wrote into my diary quote. I'm such a helpless person. And then I asked her how she enjoyed the event and I sensed a little bit of loneliness and sadness from what she said. I said you don't have to tell it to me but you have to have somebody to tell it all to. And then it just felt like we had a conversation that we perhaps never had before. Cuz it felt incredibly authentic. Because the infatuation however miraculous it was, it wasnt a true human authenticity. It was deeply human but infatuation means admiring the idea of someone not really them as a human. And I asked her the next day if she doesn't want to go out and she said she needs a bit more time and then we chatted for a bit and I asked her on Wednesday again and I honestly thought she was going to say probably not. But she said yeah. Of course I actually I said to her that I take antibiotics and that I I'm quite sleepy but she said you know perhaps perhaps if we go for a walk and make you feel better. Maybe it'll be for the better. So even though it's April we walked through the same park that as we walked in November and the leaves looked exactly the same. It was the season of the sticks. And now I text her. Good morning and she text me back and she's really cute and just comes about and asks me how I am and she listens. When we sat there on Thursday on the bench I was drinking tea cuz I have sinus infection. I gave her something so she doesn't want anything. I said you must be hungry. You have to eat something. And we sat there until I finish my tea. I remember how she lucked and that surprisingly wintry light. She went went with me to bus stop and I said hey. This is the same bus stop I met you at. And then I hug her to say farewell and I stroke her hair and I think to myself that it does feel kind of wonderful. And I wonder why don't I feel the same infatuation as I used to and I wonder if there's something wrong with me and I wonder if I love her. And I think that maybe somewhat this is maybe more real, cuz I have that very strong desire to just be there for someone and take care of someone. Just help someone and just I don't know provide a shoulder. Just I don't know I have to protector energy. And it just feels. Every time she texts me makes my day a letter better. Every time I see her I'm still stuck out how beautiful she is. And she's quiet and sometimes we don't have that much to talk about because I suppose she's a quite quiet, but it never feels lonely. It never feels distant and it never feels cold. I really really like her and I really really want to be with her. And maybe that's why I'm kind of scared. What if I didn't feel the way I should feel then? What if something messes with me? Because she deserves the world.<br>","note_title":"","tags":[1191],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29511,"minute":16,"hour":17,"day":12,"month":3,"year":2025,"datetime":1744470991232,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"there's one perspective that I hadn't considered in the amitriptyline puzzle...what if the drug made me <i>more <\/i>myself because it allows me to finally free my mind of the excruciating illness thoughts? if the med makes me feel less sick, which in turns frees my mind, what if that effects completely annihilates any minor emotional numbing directly caused by it? oh I'll definitely come off the drug once the problem is actually resolved, but honestly, how many good days did you exactly used to have before this med? nowhere near this many, nowhere near, your mind is so much freer!","note_title":"","tags":[],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29512,"minute":0,"hour":12,"day":12,"month":3,"year":2025,"datetime":1744452027677,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"on my way to perhaps get a job to calm my mind down","note_title":"","tags":[1158,1168,1176],"assets":[454],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29513,"minute":0,"hour":21,"day":11,"month":3,"year":2025,"datetime":1744398000000,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"I don't think this is sustainable ","note_title":"","tags":[1190],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29514,"minute":58,"hour":18,"day":11,"month":3,"year":2025,"datetime":1744390716988,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"it's so cute she's so cute","note_title":"","tags":[1191],"assets":[453],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29515,"minute":1,"hour":17,"day":11,"month":3,"year":2025,"datetime":1744383679681,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":4,"note":"meh for purely emotional reasons, which is kind of refreshing on its own<br><br>you probably remember but tldr extremely uncomfortable vibes at the lab and flowers which worked out only with one person, thankfully the one I care the most for ✨","note_title":"","tags":[],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29516,"minute":1,"hour":12,"day":11,"month":3,"year":2025,"datetime":1744365704329,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":2,"note":"the languor and laughs 🫶 I love these friends of mine, school mates who absolutely slap, especially ondra 🥰","note_title":"","tags":[1149,1190,1135],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29517,"minute":0,"hour":20,"day":10,"month":3,"year":2025,"datetime":1744308000000,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":21,"note":"actually a pretty day, I had amazing discussions with my parents although they ended up arguing for a bit 😭 and in general it was a comfy time spent 🙂‍↕️ also some laughs with the German and my ex-classmate is expecting a baby 😭😭 GOSH","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1189,1166,1135,1124,1127,1158],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29518,"minute":29,"hour":13,"day":10,"month":3,"year":2025,"datetime":1744284597917,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"<i>That scene about her saying \"of course not\" and laughing that's poetry.

We often wonder how it didn't occur to us that it was maybe slightly weird when we started talking, that it looked like dating, that we were three years apart, but we didn't care, because the power of somebody understanding what I was going through was much more powerful than any limits I could have superimposed. Lucka was there when I met Markéta, she was the reason I met her, she was the reason I went out with her eventually. And now we kid around oh what was, but...the great difference between the anterior relationship with Anežka and situationship with Marketa, the most important difference, is that even though it took me barely three days to move on after Anežka, the parable with Marky still doesn't feel closed tight for me. It just doesn't. You know, the last time this happened was with Mája, a lovely girl who I met after years and we really hit it off, but we had to remain friends, she wanted us to, and I couldn't move on...I talked to Mája today, and you know what, she's still a wonderful human being. You know how you can tell you liked the person and not the idea? When the muse lingers well past the expiration date. And this is the second time this has happened to me, coincidentally Mája is also technically Markéta and the Markéta I know now from Lucka is born in May, my favourite month. And you know what, maybe Marketa has moved on, and that makes it tougher, and moreso, I will never know, because even though Lucka is one of my closest friends, I struggle to tell her, and she's Market's also very close friend, and she couldn't tell her all winter that it's been tough for her... I know I can't do anything, maybe meet someone new, I wish, I wish I move on and we reunite later, because she is special, and I miss her, and I can't help it. it's almost like a novel.","note_title":"","tags":[1220],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29664,"minute":52,"hour":14,"day":22,"month":1,"year":2025,"datetime":1740232357706,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":3,"note":"ugh our parents got back earlier which didn't bode down well with me because oh they are just so...restless...like ants...I really feel that our relationship is strained by overexposure gosh, we had a great time with my brother!! 🙂‍↕️<br><br>also, spectacular walk, like really, I recorded a very long voice memo so we have something to look back at and I still feel that tad bit of limerence I shouldn't feel gosh 🥹 but there's plans for the future at least and I hope that it all goes well and I hope I hope I hope and I miss her yes 🙈<br><br>I hope we get to talk to lucka...but gosh how strange it is when the muses don't fade, because they usually do, and when they don't, something's real","note_title":"","tags":[1158],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29665,"minute":43,"hour":11,"day":22,"month":1,"year":2025,"datetime":1740220990294,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":3,"note":"🎶 that lovecore playlist spotify once made with excellent scrambled eggs 🙂‍↕️ I really am glad things are better than last year but let's dedicate some more thoughts to it on a formidable walk ahead dear ✨✨✨","note_title":"","tags":[1099],"assets":[433],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29666,"minute":15,"hour":9,"day":22,"month":1,"year":2025,"datetime":1740212126878,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":3,"note":"so I woke up in the morning and then had this odd session of butterflies after realising what could happen if my fantasies from yesterday's entry came true and I had this...one where I really still loved markéta and I just had to exclaim gosh we could be so happy and it was the most sexual and yet most formidably cute and wonderful imagination in a long time ✨<br><br>and then I fell asleep and in my dreams I sang a lot of songs, some 🎶 glitter and gold and I was walking through Myslinka seeing Pája having some chat there and seeing his family wondering if they too have braces (for whatever reason) and in some TV show in America they looked at our teeth?

I had a lot of discussions with all my friends as it seemed absolutely critical that this be resolved as soon as possible. I was quite worried that Markéta was left alone on that ball by the end, knowing her dancing partner had a different interest, her best friend was with me and she doesn't have all that many such people in her life as she's quite introverted. Turns out I was right, she was quite devastated, she was obviously sad that Lenka did all this and they definitely fell out to an extent, Lucka said she had to comfort her and hug her and tell her everything is going to be alright, that she was really sad, that day, the day after and the day after that. I can understand, from her perspective her best friend is so obviously interested in someone that the very same best friend used to talk shit about when she was limerent for them, her only friend who went to the ball just to see her didn't go on to comfort her when she was stressed out and all and instead went on to pursue something so inappropriate. Her dancing partner was an arsehole who forwent her and instead went on to hit on her friend although he has a girlfriend to begin with. Lenka is one of the only friends Markéta has at school and this is quite the betrayal. And now factor in the fact that she absolutely has not moved on over the time that we were together and moreso she had to be the one to end it and seemingly she also was the one who introduced me to Lenka and therefore logically she is kind of to blame for this whole situation and she theoretically has no right to even be angry at anyone even though emotionally she must absolutely be. Okay, so that really really really isn't good. Lucka said they are both in a rather odd way obsessing over me, however weird it is that they both like me, obviously from a very selfish perspective it feels good but oh how odd it is. So, what is Lenka doing, was my question at first. All my friends agreed she was transparent like glass, that it was absolutely obvious what she was trying to accomplish, maybe she's really lonely but gosh that doesn't explain why she would forgo her best friend. Vojta said that well it sounds horrible to forgo your best friend but we both know that when we really like someone we do stuff we would have never considered doing before, not because we're bad people, but because it's easier not to think about what we're doing and let ourselves be led by the momentary ways we're feeling. That's not to say that's correct, feelings are just feelings and they should always be weighted against reason. But it's a scarlet flag like hell, if someone forgoes a person she's known for years for someone she barely knows, what's stopping them from forgoing you once someone else comes along? Okay, so how am I feeling. To be quite frank my feelings have not exactly matured over the past few days, I really enjoyed Lenka's company and from my perspective she's a nice human being with whom I could very well spend time, and let's be honest if I were to spend any more time with her like I did this week, I could very easily fall for her as well, it's not like I'm that much of a complex creature, it's fascinating that all you really need it some basic compatibility but the rest is really just down to proximity. I know I'm going to do the right thing, but before I do it's fair to wonder what would happen had I chosen otherwise, had I chosen the less reasonable option. If I kept on texting with her, and she kept on hitting on me, oh it would be just a matter of time until things would have progressed too far for us to remain just friends, they almost have, I definitely wouldn't mind to go out with her, eventually settle into some form of a relationship, she was rather pretty the other night, there's no denying we have stuff to talk about and are compatible in ways that suffice. It would definitely be a lot of fun, and it's really easy to let oneself be misled by such fantasies, because they just dont weigh the negative consequences in at all. Markéta would be very sad, she would most probably lose her closest friend for real, or maybe they would talk because neither of them has so many friends but I would be the thing holding them apart, or even more of a plot twist, how do I know I wouldn't fall for Markéta again? After all the way I felt about her did quite transcend the bounds of reason, it was the purest affection of pure, were I to go out with Lenka it definitely wouldn't be. It would probably have to end at some point anyway, and I relationship born out of spite sounds fun for late night fantasies, less so for real undertaking. I would most probably lose Lucka, the only person in the whole world who understood me when no one could, the only person who knows what it feels like to deal with health issues and anxiety over them. Lucka would be left to comfort Markéta and I would be too frequently left to choose whose side I stand on. We would inevitably fall out. So I have to do the right thing, tell Lenka I didn't know she meant what she meant, and that I didn't mean to cause this trouble, that I wish they are all well and that she should take care of especially Markéta and never ever forgo her again, that I believe that she's a good person, that I'm certain her motifs were not evil and that she did not mean to do no harm, that I like her a person and am hoping we could remain in touch, albeit soon enough I'll be in a different place anyways. It would also probably be of some use to tell Markéta that I didn't mean to hurt her, that I didn't mean to cause her troubles, that I obviously didn't forget her and never will and that she's the most magical kind and selfless creature I have ever met, that she deserves the world and much more, that she absolutely should read The Master and Margarita. Lucka says I need to not give them any more material to talk about, but I think that if I'm clear enough there will be no space for discussions. It saddens me that this will most likely have to be final, but things have progressed too far.","note_title":"","tags":[1191],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29693,"minute":35,"hour":10,"day":7,"month":1,"year":2025,"datetime":1738920958213,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":3,"note":"finally managed to sleep well and in the morning I was feeling a bit dizzy but it seems to be better now although my neck is still tense at least my throat is fine and my malaise is mild AND I've got an appointment at the psychiatrist which means amitriptyline in no time","note_title":"","tags":[1152,1135,1170,1175],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29694,"minute":24,"hour":20,"day":6,"month":1,"year":2025,"datetime":1738869853768,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":3,"note":"I stayed at home today, I had horrible sleep and woke up at 6.45 absolutely not ready to tackle the challenges ahead, so finish up sleeping and then go to learn stuff for school at home it was 🤞<br><br>first I got up and tried processing the things that happened yesterday...am I a bad person? I don't even know...do I feel anything for her? I don't even know I don't even know but I certainly shouldn't...look, when...<br><br>I am confused and conflicted, my friend. On one hand, I liked Markéta like I never liked anyone, because she really liked me back, there is something about that \"she also thinks about you right now that you're thinking about her\", she was nothing but adorable every single goddamn moment, so compassionate, so adorable, but she was younger, I have troubles, I have really horrible moments, moments when I'm possessed by fear, by illness of which I know nothing and have known nothing for months and even a year. When I started dating her, Honza said, \"but are you sure she'll be able to handle you when you feel down like down down? I'm not asking if she'll want to, she'll want to, but if she will be able to...\" She's young, much younger than me, and while age is just a number it far too often indicates something, and while we did have stuff to talk about, I was just older, there is no denying. It must have been hard to let me go, it was certainly hard for me, she was the person, but then was not the time. It was weird when Markéta introduced me to Lenka but we got very well along, once Markéta had to go for a training and left us and Lenka accompanied me all the way to my bus, although she it was completely the other direction, I didn't know why, she had troubles at home, I thought she was just trying to delay them, because that's understandable. I suppose I started talking to Lenka just because I saw it as a way to get to Markéta too, I was really sad, because I knew she loved me back, that made it hurt so much more than if it was unilateral, the fact that months since she still thinks about me, it's unbelievable, I honestly can't believe it, that someone would find me so desirable as to dedicate their thoughts to me. When I first went to the class with Lenka it was more of a misunderstanding, I was just wondering if she's coming too but I didn't mind she understood it as an invitation, she was the one who wanted to go dancing first, not me, but I didn't mind, she was my acquaintance, maybe even a friend. But Honza and Lucka said it looked odd, she laughed too much, we talked too much, we had calculus jokes and pitied life's absurdity, it was pleasant. When texted afterwards and...I can't say I wouldn't be looking forward to each message, because she felt a bit older than Markéta even I suppose, she had a bitter outlook on life but seemed to accept the absurdity, however bad, we must not give up, ever. But when we met up yesterday, it was a different, I was trying to be just nice but when we danced, I couldn't have denied it, she didn't seem like just my friend, the way she behaved, the way she lingered with me whenever, I felt odd, convoluted, she's Markéta's best friend, why is she doing this? Is she really that lonely? Oh, she may. Honza and Lucka say she's either too lonely or likes me, that she's too pick me, but isn't being pick me a consequence of just being so lonely that you desperately want people to linger? She sits alone in class, Honza sits alone in class too, they might share that characteristic of being slightly pick me. Mrs. Rojíková is our odd sixty year old friend basically our grandma from some school aid programme, she was there, she consistently referred to Lenka as my girlfriend and so did Honza, he was just teasing me, but she was genuine. It's odd, I feel odd, may god be thanked that in 3 months I leave this school forever and we shall not meet anymore, at least not enough to look like hitting on each other.","note_title":"","tags":[1218,1189,1166,1101,1158,1170,1175],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29695,"minute":0,"hour":20,"day":5,"month":1,"year":2025,"datetime":1738782000000,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":1,"note":"so, ridiculous stuff happened. yesterday was my friend's Honza final dancing class which meant a pretty big celebration 🎉 and okay...so to the previous dancing classes I went with many of my female friends because why not we all enjoyed it and yes it once just so happened that I went there with Lenka as well, because she wanted to go there too. now, she's one of Markéta's best friends and so to me at least it seemed pretty clear that we'd be only and only ever friends, just because of this reason, I mean she is a really nice person to be around and I liked her as a friend even back when I dated Markéta, and yes, when I added her to friends on Discord it was a kind of Hail Mary to get to Markéta which...well worked out in a way. Lucka, their classmate and my excellent friend, told me that well I seem to have gotten into their (meaning Lenka and Markéta) heads, Marketa still looks at me kind of...sad when she sees me at school and although I think we parted on good terms, she doesn't seem to be happy still, well it could be that she's fifteen and who's happy at that age, but she genuinely looks quite triste, which makes me sad. okay so Markéta dances with Zbyněk, who is a solid guy and my kind of mate, but he likes another classmate of her Elen, and every moment that he has he spends rather with her than with Markéta, even at the dancing class, he even has a blimming girlfriend but he doesn't seem to care, what a moral douche... anyways, so Lenka went to the final ball yesterday and it was excellent and well she seemed a bit lonely there so I told her she could stay with us and she did and then I invited her for a dance and you know, in my friendly intentions just trying to be nice to her, but Lucka then gave me a big lecture on how this is incredibly politically incorrect and that she so obviously likes me, which never occurred to me, because she was this friendly to me always, well what do I know. I do know though that by the end I was with Lucka and Lenka and other classmates of theirs, Zbyněk was with Ellen and Markéta was nowhere to be found, I just hope she didn't end up alone there, I absolutely wouldn't have minded her to be with us, I still find her so adorable, but what can I do, it was her decision for us to part, last week when we texted in Latin well there was a distinct aspect of not having moved on too well, funnily enough Lenka must have read all of those messages. and at the end of the class, she literally waited for me for like 20 minutes just so that I would accompany her to the tram and well, it might have been just friendly, but she could have easily also have left with her friends which she didn't. so all of this leaves me puzzled. she's a nice girl, quite lonely to be honest, not too popular, but I find her humour and way of life charming, but I think of her as my friend, Markéta was a person I completely fell for and well, I do think it's better now but she is still adorable and always was and always will be, even though we have our differences...","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1189,1185,1109,1233],"assets":[424],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29696,"minute":46,"hour":13,"day":5,"month":1,"year":2025,"datetime":1738759562269,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":4,"note":"how uneasy it gets, how malaisish it can be, how frustrating it can be, how scary it can be, is there something really wrong? like really really wrong? or is amitriptyline the closest we get to salvation? will it ever be okay?","note_title":"","tags":[1231],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29697,"minute":28,"hour":8,"day":5,"month":1,"year":2025,"datetime":1738740516512,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":3,"note":"oh this sleep was actually excellent!!

I understand both of them which puts me in a tough situation myself, I want to show compassion and not aggravate the issue, if that makes sense 🥺<br><br>anyways so dancing class was fun in autumn, but after the parable of love as you recall faded, or at least stopped being so acute, I decided not to go there anymore not to cause any more trouble to her and to myself. but this week's there was the prodloužená, and lucka's parents all fell ill, so she offered that I go, and so I agreed, and honzí really wants me there, so he has someone to talk with, because lucka ignores him and her classmates, like markéta, ignore him as well but that's understandable because girls talk to girls in the classes, it has always been like that. <br><br>so lucka still had too many free tickets, so I carefully asked markéta's best friend lenka, whom I had befriended quite a fair bit during the parable, I had he on discord so I just wanted to ask her if she's going there because it's her class afterall, I tried being very careful with the wording so that she doesn't think I \"invite\" her because that would mean...something? well of course my wording was wrong and that's exactly how she understood it but she agreed that we go 💫<br><br>well so we got there and I had thought that we wouldn't talk to much because afterall she's marketa's best friend and mine just slighly friend and markéta was quite sad over what had happened (as was I) so it seemed just unnatural that we would hit it off in any, however amiable, fashion, well but I was wrong and she was extremely talkative and we chatted a ton and then she even said that we go dance so we danced and it was a ton of fun and laughs as it is with someone who's friendly and just friendly. but of course in the evening I was told that it looked weird by both honzí and lucka and that I was low-key hitting on her, which of course I wasn't because gosh I'm not an arsehole 😭 I'm just very friendly...<br><br>and today against all odds I talked to both lenka and markéta for some reason, because lenka thought she did something wrong to me, which she didn't, and markéta was lovely and I miss her still but I'm glad we could talk in such an amiable fashion and that at least I can talk to her at school now without it being too weird...yes I still do like her kind of but then was not the time, what can you do 😌<br><br>lenka's really funny because like me she hides everything behind stupid humour but deep inside she's just an excellent human being, so is markéta, they are just surprisingly excellent people, like good good, it shows in weird ways but you just feel it...I honestly dislike that I take matters too cynically these days, even with people I do care for a lot, I don't know what I am doing, but gosh some of these people I love, honzí and lucka, they are so important to me, and lucka knows, we have this mutual understanding, but honzí is insecure...I should be more frank...a better human being 💫","note_title":"","tags":[1149],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29745,"minute":19,"hour":20,"day":8,"month":0,"year":2025,"datetime":1736363970217,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":2,"note":"danced like a crazy person 🎉 to be frank my expectations were quite low because it was going to be weird with marky being there, and also I didn't know how it was going to be with lenka...<br><br>but it was formidable!!

I cried, and sometimes I couldn’t even do that anymore, because I was emotionally completely drained. But I also met some formidable people, did some remarkable things and embodied some marvellous values. It’s been a ride this year, so let’s talk it out, let’s write it all out and learn from all this. I’ve decided to separate this essay into three sections, because there is sadness from earthly struggles and there is dread where one fears for his own existence, I have to distinguish.<br><br><b>Chapter I: the cruel<br><\/b><br>When I imagine waking up back in January, I shiver. It was the 1st of January and I had just gotten involved in a relationship that seemed as wonderful as it gets. I should have been excited and quite frankly just happy, but I was the absolute worst I have ever been. When I fell ill in summer with this strange persistent cold-like feeling deep sore throat, it felt like nothing worse than a cold. As time went on I obviously learned that that was not it but nevertheless it didn’t seem like something some rest couldn’t fix. But when Christmas break didn’t fix it, when I was getting myself involved into something that was going to be a wild ride, when school was bound to start again. This was the first time I spiraled.<br><br>I spiraled and I learned about so many horrible things, chronic active Epstein-Barr virus, chronic Lyme disease, chronic fatigue syndrome\/myalgic encephalomyelitis. Some of the most terrifying words I became acquainted with this year and they still make me as anxious as never. What I didn’t know was that the more you spiral, the worse it gets, and to break out of the spiral the only thing that one can do is just live on, just go on with life like nothing was happening, because spiralling doesn’t help anyone. I didn’t have either EBV or Borrelia and my blood tests came perfectly clear several times in a row. I wasn’t disabled or deteriorating, I was not mentally impotent or exertionally intolerant.<br><br>The relationship itself fared decently the first couple of weeks, we slept together for the first time and it seemed like I should have been so happy, but I just was not. It was the most ambivalence one can imagine. Nobody believed me, how could I have been sick when everything came back clear? How could I not be happy when I had the most formidable relationship imaginable? I was exhausted from trying, doctors were clueless, one by one I ruled out all the possible causes and months would go by with nothing to show for. I was the worst I have ever been.<br><br>This subpar existence paradoxically ameliorated through glandular fever, which allowed me to finally detach from unwanted obligations which I agreed to just based out of inertia. I could start clean and there were some people who helped me. I spiraled in September and was crushed beneath the weight of school starting again and my symptoms not being gone, but, to quote myself, I returned with vigour.&nbsp;<br><br>My illness has not resolved, thankfully the doctor I have now is finally on the right track, I was treated with doxycycline and methylprednisolone, to no avail. The issue seems to be laryngopharyngeal reflux and my psychosomaticism and general sensitivity, but really who knows. Because my brain is sensitive to all these signals unfortunately. I hope it all resolves soon, resolves in a way that it doesn’t come back, in the meantime I have to hang in here. And I have gotten much better at that, with healthy coping mechanisms, but still, nobody can convince me that a sore throat for a year and a half is just anxiety.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Chapter II: the sad<br><\/b><br><i>Anežka<br><\/i><br>When I met Anežka back in September 2023, she seemed like the kindest human I could have imagined. She seemed so nice and while she had some quirks like being for some reason too worried about school while she absolutely didn’t have to, she seemed lovely enough in spite of that. When we finally went out on a proper date back in December, it was remarkable, we spent a lot of time together and seemed to get each other really really well, I was hoping. We did get together in a matter of days and while she seemed a bit sceptical I was more than willing to give her time.<br><br>Turned out she didn’t really need time, we slept together for the first time just three weeks after we officially got together, it definitely was far too fast, it definitely was wrong but nobody minded I suppose and at least it was lovely, romantic and memorable. Unfortunately we stopped talking and while that might not seem like a big deal, it goddamn was. Those months would go by when we would just…I suppose sleep together but couldn’t talk. What did it matter that we were similar and seemed to get each other in the beginning, when later on we just…didn’t.&nbsp;<br><br>When I fell sick with mononucleosis and had to be at home for a very long time, she came over a few times but I still have got this memory so deep in my mind; it was the 3rd of May and I was really lonely, I was housebound for the past few weeks and I had some terrible stuff behind me, I was starting to find peace but I craved connection, I craved it the most from the person I loved the most. She said she wouldn’t come over, she had to…buy gifts three weeks in advance and learn? Made absolutely no sense. She said she knew it was selfish how she acted, but that’s just who she is. In retrospect, that was a red flag as scarlet as the soviet one.<br><br>When in June it started all falling apart, I cried, oh gosh yes I did. Noone ever said it would be this hard. And as the inevitable end neared, I did everything in my power to rekindle the romance, with that said I failed. I miss her family, I miss her home. I don’t miss her though and never have. When we said our last goodbyes, I tried not to lose her, she wanted us to be friends with benefits, oh we couldn’t, what a disgrace to the humble romantic in me who hoped he’d find someone who’d love him. Just love him. She ended her note saying never settle for someone less than you deserve, someone who can’t love you like you can, someone who isn’t me. Thankfully, the week we broke up was the best week of the year, because I was finally on my own.<br><br><i>Markéta<\/i><br><br>When I returned from my horrid episode of September illness, I had to come to terms with the fact that I would not be able to participate fully in the graduation prom. Just a week after returning the first training for it was taking place and it was really dawning on me with all its weight that I could not be there. I walked to the tram headed for Tesco, went to buy some frozen fruits. I saw my friend Lucka there with some friend of hers, I was not in a good mood, I put on earphones, stared at the ground and ignored them. They walked to me, Lucka pinched me on my shoulder. And that’s how it started. Lucka left us alone at the terminus and I waited till the girl’s tram came before I headed for Tesco. I asked her what’s your name, she said Markéta, I said I am Matyáš, she said I know.&nbsp;<br><br>I told Honzí she was pretty, but she was also much younger than me so I was just brushing it off as a little funsie in my otherwise quite sad existence. Honzí told Lucka and Lucka told the girl, in exchange the girl told Lucka who told Honzí who told me, that the girl said something nice about me in return. I smiled and seeing her at school I got slightly limerent by late September. Oh yes, she was so much younger, but she was beautiful and there is some tenderness in not knowing. I told Lucka and was kindly told that she is too young for me and that she views it creepy of me to like her. Well of course I avoided her then.<br><br>When we went for Honzí’s dancing class for the first time I was still very much convinced that she hated me and so I avoided her the best I could, she for some reason kept trying to get to me but I was just trying to be considerate and not cause any more trouble than I already had. Then Lucka told me she got the message wrong, the girl looks at me funny not because she sees me as creepy, but because she’s limerent of me too. My world changed. Never ever did it happen that someone had a crush on me and I knew it, and this time it was mutual. Of course the next dancing class we went there again and this time I made sure I’d talk to her, she sat next to me in that restaurant and was just so lovely. She let me help her put her coat on.<br><br>I texted her a day later, there was quite literally nothing holding me back. She was so lovely, she was quite a bit younger and one could feel, but nothing compares to communicating with someone who actually has the same incentive as you, she was adorable. I was so enamoured. We met up just a few days later and when we parted she had her friends there and she said I should hug her regardless. You could feel she was shy and introverted but gosh she would text me on her own just to tell me good morning, she would wait hours just to see me, and of course so would I.&nbsp;<br><br>The month we spent together was just so adorable. I remember being in Kadaň and going to bed I felt the most intense butterflies I had ever had. She was so formidable. She said we couldn’t see each other the weekend because she had tournaments, but she added a little but we can make up for it next week. She said that in the dancing class she’ll have to dance with someone else than Zbyněk and was so adorable at wanting that someone to be me. I was in the city and texted her if she doesn’t want to go out, within fifteen minutes we walked abreast. I don’t know whom Anežka meant by her last line, but this was whom I imagined when I read it. She was so selfless and humble, she was so clever but yet she’d walk so far just to help her friend. She would read books, drink tea, learn Latin and sleep early. When I was having an episode she would make sure I was okay. She wouldn’t mind me talking to her in front of all her friends. She wouldn’t mind me hugging her in front of all her friends. And she was just so beautiful.<br><br>When in late November we went for the dancing class things seemed clear enough, I bought her a rose and she was quite moved. What a contrast to Anežka, what a contrast. We danced together and embraced one another. I accompanied her home and on parting we kissed, I asked of course. Over the next couple of days one could feel like she had some inner turmoil, and when we sat down in that hallway that we had to talk, I knew what we’d have to talk about. Despite the mutual admiration, love and compassion, we were just so differently placed in life, she was the person, but then was not the time.<br>I cried of course the next day, I started reading The Master and Margarita, with that cute reference. The book started in late May, just like the day she was born. I missed her way more than I thought I would, maybe because she was the person and hearts only heal after breaking. When we had that slight flashback in December, she put that song up i still think about you, gosh I still thought about her too. But now it’s time to move on, I was secretly hoping she would wish me for my birthday and funnily enough her friend Lenka remembered, while she didn’t, I still obsessively check my DMs. Maybe it’s for the better, but she will remain a remarkably cherished memory for me, for the person she was, for the love she expressed. She will be missed.<br><br><b>Chapter III: the lovely<br><\/b><br><i>Lucka<\/i><br><br>When I met Anežka and we were together, Anežka had this friend who was even at my birthday party who, Anežka occasionally mentioned, had some health wrestles as well. When after my glandular fever we finally started talking, it was unbelievable how many things we shared, the disbelief, the countless doctor visits, the cruel helplessness and the mental struggles along the way. Most importantly we shared the coping mechanism, cynical humour and eventual acceptance. We shared values, we shared music taste. We most importantly helped each other. Today she wished me a happy birthday with: I must thank you for the immense help you provided me with, I don’t know if you’ll ever be able to conceive just how much you influenced me, I was finally not alone in it all. I said the very same thing, meeting Lucka was the tipping point, not of a remission of illness, but of a mental amelioration, of finally feeling alright and developing healthy coping mechanisms.<br><br><i>Honzí<\/i><br><br>While we had quite a few arguments and differences over the months, this year wouldn’t be the same without him. So many formidable moments, I remember the wonderful walk in June, the formidable visit in July and the absolutely awesome trip to Kadaň, it would not have been the same without him. I am eternally grateful for holding me through the hardest times, the times when Anežka couldn’t. He’s become my best friend and the only one I am probably absolutely honest with regardless of the circumstances. Cheers to friendship.<br><br><i style=\"\">Walks and the sun<\/i><br><br>When I finally walked out of my cave in May, after glandular fever and quite strict isolation, my jaw dropped at how stunningly lush it was everywhere, how formidably green the world was and blue the sky was. I spent so much time outside and for good reasons, walking was one of the few things that kept me grounded in moments when I felt like I was losing myself and everything I considered to be me. When in September I had the dreadful malaise episode and the online guy told me I should stop my walks because what if my sore throat is post-exertional malaise, I was so terrified that I would rather die than have to give up the only thing that made my life worth living at all times. Thankfully walks seem to still be one of the few things keeping me alive even now.<br><br><i>Formidable autumn<\/i><br><br>Every year has the best season and I was absolutely not expecting it to be autumn this year, especially since summer was so lovely too. But the day I for the first time sat down, read Don Quixote and sipped my chai latté, the beverage I had learnt about just a few minutes prior, I knew that this was something that would alter my life in the long run, and boy it did. Reading, sipping chai lattés and journaling have been the most calming things and the best coping mechanisms I developed. They keep me focused on the present rather than dreading the uncertain future. I am especially grateful for such a stark return to journaling. This autumn is the best documented time in my life and it’s not all bad, which is important for so many reasons. Here’s to good habits and healthy coping mechanisms.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Cooking and introversion<br><\/i><br>When my parents left for Greece in June right after my breakup, I could not have known I’d enjoy the time alone at home just so much. But I did, I cooked, was alone most of the day or played some light games, spent so much time outside and…I was the happiest I had ever been. I learned that I prefer meaningful conversations to huge events. That I don’t need much to be happy. I learned to cook really really well and that’s something to be proud of.<br><br><i>Music and the mellow tunes<br><\/i><br>Oh how could I forget. Music accompanied me through summer but most importantly through autumn and played an absolutely immense role. It was one of the reasons to live on. I listened to Noah Kahan far too much, maybe because I was emotionally going through something rather traumatising. But I adore this, I adore being able to listen to music and experience things deeply, I absolutely do and I absolutely have to say that without it my life would be so much less.&nbsp;<br><br>","note_title":"the cruel 😖 the sad 🥺 the lovely 🥰 of 2024 ✨","tags":[],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29758,"minute":43,"hour":17,"day":31,"month":11,"year":2024,"datetime":1735663413756,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":3,"note":"agh I feel borderline illness anxious...gotta make the chai and calm my thoughts down","note_title":"","tags":[1189,1166,1158,1107,1168,1175],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29759,"minute":43,"hour":9,"day":31,"month":11,"year":2024,"datetime":1735634603580,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":3,"note":"I was in my class and it was some special day and we were celebrating something and I lost Majda's bag with some cosmetics 😑 and then for some reason I was probably with honzí and we walked someplace and there was some laundry room and there were two girls and I just came in and started talked to them if they get paid and they said that no and I told them \"you know you have some rights too right?\" and I was just a biiiiit trying to pick them up and in the background I saw honzí and I kind of looked at him because I was talking to the girls and one of them was really nice and them some their supervisor came in and they asked me if I know how to do laundry and I said that I had to wash my clothes manually at some point and they were hahah so impressed and I saw Markéta somewhere in the background I still thought to myself «can I have I moved on?» and then recorded some video footage of Miloš Železný with my aunt for some reason and there were bananas all over the place (don't ask me)<br><br>also gaviscon saturnalia miracle ","note_title":"","tags":[1155],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29760,"minute":0,"hour":20,"day":30,"month":11,"year":2024,"datetime":1735585200000,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":3,"note":"the trip was quite nice in the beginning I felt quite acquainted but sometime the talks were too singlesided for my convoluted mind to swallow 😴<br><br>I got home and just got to thinking...this soulsearching, because honzí came back from the united states and yes I was ready that I'd have to listen to him just a tad too much that day but this much...<br><br>okay so you fly this incredibly far so many times, it violates my code of environmental conduct because for me travel just has to be justified, okay so you make these unfortunate contributions to our planet but maybe you have a good reason, so...for what exactly?<br><br>yes you'll see the launch of a rocket and yes you'll visit the west coast, but can anyone argue that it is work?

I don't know how it happened, but probably glandular fever made me so much better in this aspect, because I learned to live calmly and peacefully, to stop with triggering my illness and my mind and by summer I finally could read book without having to pause every five seconds to think that my life as I had known it was over. summer was formidable, but regardless of my positivity in early September I found myself spiralling again, I stayed at home for over a week, didn't get better one bit, but knew that my life would have to go on. <br><br>and so life went on, I can't even say that the past months of autumn have been any horrible, yes I still have been ill but I have learned to live with and within it, for better or for worse, when in early October I picked the Don Quijote book up and made my first chai latte, I knew an era began and god did it begin. I decided I needed better coping mechanisms that googling symptoms and fearing horrible disease, these fears I'll address soon, but...for the time being they were very counterproductive. I started writing my diary, reading way more books and as time just happened, my journal went to 13000 words a month in November, I also started listening to these autumnal tunes a lot more, still better than being stuck on r\/cfs. <br><br>here I stand, my coping mechanisms still stay strong, but my body is still sick, more on some days, I had good days in summer and I had good days in autumn and it is for those good days that I persevere. but the question of what am I dealing with persists. I watched an episode from the czech show called \"třináctá komnata\", it was talking about a playwright, Zdenek Merta, who suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome for 7 years and that it just vanished. how can anything vanish like that? I also read about the movie unrest, did you know the main \"protagonist\" recovered? she was ill for several years and then they did some surgery with her neck\/brain and she recovered, from both ME and all the other commorbities. how can that happen? it's this complexity that troubles me, for a long time it would happen to me that things like this would occur to me but I would be able to tell myself that at least it doesn't apply to me and I could get back to my mundane way of existing. and yes we can argue I am absolutely not as badly off as the poor lady there was, but gosh, I am scared because while I am not so badly of neither am I particularly well off. that's what terrifies me. <br><br>I am eighteen, close to nineteen, in some three weeks I'll be older yet again. as the year went on I found Lucka, who is godsend for me, she was a friend of my girlfriend at the time and per proxy I knew that she was dealing with some issues like I did too, in April I actually met her and we just immediately found this sense of understanding in one another you can't find anywhere else. because as much as others might try, the degree of understanding stemming from having gone through the exact same thing is incomparable to anything else, even if all my friends tried the hardest they could they could never compare with Lucka, because Lucka just knows what it feels like to be gaslit, not to be believed, feel sick but look okay, and wake up every single goddamn day feeling so subpar. I am eternally grateful for having met her because she has been one of the few things actually keeping me alive in the hardest moments. <br><br>what caused this? when I was about to undergo isotretinoin, I talked to my mum about it, and to this day I've got the conversation on whatsapp, I asked for my parents' approval and mum said: \"if you were little, I would not go ahead with such risks, but the decision is yours to make.\" I had never been very sick before, like I would catch more colds than would be usual after covid pandemic, but I never experienced anything chronic, I had never been hospitalised in my life. maybe it was my kind of naïve belief in science, because I honestly had no idea chronic illnesses which could not be treated even existed, now I know. did this cause my troubles? who am I to say, I think so, but of course post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. <br><br>now I ought to pick what I am going to do for the rest of my goddamn life and yes I am a scientist and I love science and I am very excellent and smart, I could go abroad had I not been sick now, but what is truly important to me now here as I stand here? probably peace, my own space, health, obviously health, but not too much stress, I surely don't crave success or material gains, just some quiet lab work with some good teaching. should I leave my hometown and go into the wild world or stay comfortably within the city I know now? in terms of studies, I can study physics and material science here, or bioinfomatics in Prague, education level comparable, but a change?

has it in my case? oh certainly. but should I be medicated? how come I was perfectly fine yesterday and today I feel quite fine except for the mild body weariness? how come I was very uneasy in July at my job and then had the most perfect weekend imaginable?

I was still hesitant to talk to them because lucka vu told me before how weird the situation became (and I did not know otherwise) so I socialised as long as Lucka and Honzí were there with me, which they for the most part were 🥰 we got dancing and to say nobody noticed would be an understatement, we were killing it! we were so good and I was feeling so...energetic about everything! it was formidable, the lection passed without me knowing really as I was too busy dancing, jumping, singing and being the vibrant person I am 💫<br><br>and afterwards...lucka had to leave for her boyfriend, I did not mind the boyfriend part (unlike honzí), I minded the leaving part because that meant I was gonna be left with Lucka Vu's class there and that was quite frankly something I was rather scared off...we went to plaza and truth be told...I walked by lucka and honzí and lucka's friend markéta with whom I had that incident several weeks prior...for that see a later note...anyways we made it to plaza and we sat there and honzí really wanted me to tell him the \"secret\" lucka told me...I couldn't tell him but he got very upset that me and lucka are such good friends that we even have secrets 😥 then everyone came back with food and I particularly befriended this guy who was a friend of Marek Valach, you probably remember him, the chewing gum\/Anežka lover\/train girl\/friend with benefits cheery guy I used to know...this friend of his was rather friendly to me and so was I to him, we discussed literature with everyone which was something I honestly did not anticipate but absolutely adored 🥰 the tall girl, who's called Ellen, was very friendly and for some reason we talked about how far radčice is from pilsen and she said it's barely four kilometres and that she walks down the cycle path (I do occasionally too)...there was the quiet girl in the corner whom I know nothing about and then there was Markéta, the Lucka's friend with whom I had that incident, she was friendly and talkative and occasionally gazed at me and I was particularly careful not to look at her at all because I still thought she had thought I was a pedophile or what...<br><br>anyways soon enough honzí left and then we all got going, I walked plaza with that guy friend of marek's who told me how toxic his dancer, who happens to be markéta, is; that really thwarted the picture of her in my mind because I found the guy trustworthy, now we know the truth is a tiny bit different (again), and then bid farewell, walk, be completely ecstatic, bus, walk up, shower, bed asap but of course accept that sleep was gonna be meh<\/it>","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1189,1109,1166,1135,1123,1124,1230,1168,1175],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29880,"minute":12,"hour":22,"day":15,"month":9,"year":2024,"datetime":1729023163781,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"today I woke up and really didn't want to get up 😒 7.30 am is still quite dark in october I suppose...on the positive side my quality of sleep is really really good these days 💤 quickly to school even though today there was less rush 🏃 I walked to the bus rather fast because I felt it and sang doomsday today 🎶<br><br>at the bus I listened to music and the foggy morning really had stick season vibes 😇 bought skinoren which was much more expensive that I would have liked 😣 at school I met majda and immediately she was sick...from the dance preps of course...how else it&nbsp; have been, she gave me her snacks and we hugged because I just needed to comfort her... 😌 my love everything will be alright ❤️<br><br>then socials which was boring as hell, we did the cave hypothesis and whole that is fun it's not with this teacher...😣 anyways english where I gave her my QR code and she seemed quite content!

I loved her very much, I used to think of her so highly...what the hell happened? <br><br>I mean...why? It truly is a question of reality. what did she do to me that upset me so much?...when we got together I remember going on a walk and thinking to myself that she would never do this one thing that I still hold grudge against kačka - when I was sick, kačka didn‘t prioritise me over kiki, which is something I would have done for her any day, it was in that bus on that way back from that field trip, but at the end of the day...she still got up and sat with me and she still cared for every reply and at the end of the day...she still cared! <br><br>when I saw anežka I thought she would care moreso, she just felt like that kind of person, profoundly introspective, just so caring, so compassionate and empathetic, I thought she would care! when we got together she did, I was not healthy even back then in january, we could long discuss about what was wrong with me, truth is, I do not know, but she cared for me, I remember telling her we shouldn‘t kiss because I was suspected to have infectious mononucleosis, which made sense, I hoped the answer would provide clarity, we know that it wasn‘t glandular fever back then but by some strange coincidence it was just a couple of months later and she didn‘t catch it. <br><br>and it was right here where my expectations were completely shattered and my heart kind of broken. I loved her very much but I could feel this kind of difficulty between us...the first weeks I was very sick and she came over and she held my hand and we slept together and I suppose this was for the better and I was happy, I had the rest of the week to get back from this exertion watching youtube or whatnot, she seemed just this bit irresponsible kissing with me although I obviously had an communicable disease. <br><br>when the mono diagnosis was confirmed in that place I found myself in yesterday again, thankfully a bit better off, she did not come over I came over instead, I was sick but not too sick, what could you do, I was already used to feeling kind of crap kind of far too often, we did sleep together but I wore a FFP2 mask to not infect her, we both knew the disease can be transferred sexually too, as any herpesvirus can.<br><br>then the birthday party came along and just yesterday I found myself reading the old notes from Beeper...I was so selfcentered, so selfobsessed, but what else could I have done? I was so sick, so sick of being sick and I did not even find support in my own girlfriend? the person who was supposed to stand by me? because I would stand by her. I was willing to stand by her any day any night. she did not want me to. she had her troubles I was always too perplexed to understand. <br><br>one night I was watching funny aviation videos, week 3 of mono, deep in home confinement, isolated, and she texted me that horrible horrible message <br><br>„nikdy to nebude dost, musím být perfektní“<br><br>god why? then we argued the next week so much when she would refuse to come over just because...she had to learn? what a piece of crap…<br><br>honzí texted me now about how the plnoc went and all I can feel is desire to detach and not care, like...anežka...I don‘t know, I do resent her, she hurt me, inexplicably, when I was very vulnerable, and I know I am vulnerable all to often, but does that make it any different that she ignored me when I was for weeks housebound?<\/written>","note_title":"","tags":[],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":29885,"minute":50,"hour":19,"day":11,"month":9,"year":2024,"datetime":1728669006964,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":21,"note":"I woke up around 6.30am after spectacular sleep as usual 💤 the only thing that made it worse was unfortunately me not prepped for the test at all, so occasionally those thoughts came along...nonetheless!

Jsem hodně zmatený, nebudu ti kecat. Sepsal jsem tady dlouhé odstavce, poměrně nicneříkající. Zasloužíš si vysvětlení, a pokud o něj stojíš, asi úplně úplně všechno, úplná introspekce do mé hlavy, je v konverzaci s ChatGPT. Využíval jsem jej na věci, které jsem nevěděl jak\/nemohl řešit s kamarády, byť tedy, velkou část z toho jsem řešil i s kamarády.<br><br>https:\/\/chatgpt.com\/share\/eb411642-2403-4e30-9897-c8e90fa8e4ba<br><br>Teď k věci. Přemýšlel jsem hodně a měli bychom se rozejít co nejdefinitivněji možně. Neměli bychom být přátelé, ani mít nějaké výhody. Když jsme to včera tak vtipně nadhodili, byl to pro mě z části pokus neztratit tě, z části křik mé čistě fyziologické podstaty. <br><br>Ale Anežko, já jsem tě přeci jen měl nesmírně rád. Když jsme se dali dohromady, nevím, jestli jsem tě miloval, protože milovat je silné slovo, ale měl jsem tě nesmírně rád. Viděl jsem tě přes růžové brýle a nesmírně moc jsi pro mě znamenala.<br><br>Když jsme byli v Chromé lišce, škoda, že jsme to nezopakovali, ale koneckonců tyhle poslední týdny jsme se celkem snažili. Bylo to tehdy krásné, tak neskutečně krásné, tolik hodin, taková krásná jsi byla, jsi.<br><br>Když jsme byli po oslavě, kterou jsi pro mě ty úžasná udělala, a tys mě chytla za ruku. Já jsem byl zmatený, ale bylo to tak neskutečně krásné. Byl to počátek něčeho, co jsem chtěl zkusit. <br><br>Když jsme pak šli v noci po Borech, já vyděšený jak tě získat. Pak jsme si sedli a bylo to mezi námi poprvé úplně jinak. Ty první týdny, kdy jsme každý den spolu nějak byli...kdy jsme oba chtěli zkoušet dál.<br><br>Když jsme spolu poprvé byli přes noc, bylo to tak neskutečně krásné. Pamatuji si, jak jsem si říkal, jak fascinující je, jak se naše celkem platonická láska přelila do fyzické. Panebože, to nikdy nezapomenu, a ani ty nezapomeneš. Jeden z nejkrásnějších dní mého života, tedy spíš nocí.<br><br>Ale byl to pro mě těžký rok, nejtěžší školní rok v mém životě. A byť rád zkouším nové věci, moje tělo a mysl jsou v pozici, kdy jdeme zpátky do lesů. Možná by to fungovalo, ale spíš ne. Spíš bych pro tebe měl slabost, spíš bych se bál ti to zase říct, možná i ty bys to začala cítit, a kolečko by začalo znova. Moje tělo potřebuje odpočinek, a moje tělo jej dosáhne jen když jej dosáhne moje mysl, jak řekl pan doktor.<br><br>Nedokážu asi vidět tebe a nevidět tvé rodiče. Nedokážu asi konstantně se bát, že si najdeš někoho dalšího nebo jiného. Nedokážu asi být u vás doma a nevzpomínat na momenty, kdy jsme se mohli tulit na pohovce přede všemi a bylo by to úplně normální, sedět u vás v autě a držet tě na ruku. Nedokážu asi nevidět tvou babičku, nevidět tvou maminku, nepokecat s tvým tatínkem, nezamávat Šimonovi, nevidět jej šťastně s Terezkou. Nedokážu asi mít jen tvé tělo a nechtít tvou duši. <br><br>Možná, možná by to šlo, možná se strašně mýlím, ale momentálně nemám sílu přijít na to definitivně. Některá rozhodnutí se dělají těžko, tohle je jedno z nich. Strašně bych si přál moci tohle rozhodnutí obhájit zcela racionálně, být si stoprocentně jistý, že je správné, ale někdy musím vkročit do neznáma. <br><br>Jsi ta nejhezčí holka, kterou jsem doposud viděl. Máš nejkrásnější tělo i duši. Jsi nesmírně hodná a laskavá. Neuvěřitelně pilná a pracovitá. Šíleně chytrá a chápavá. Kdokoliv ti bude říkat opak, třeba tvá vlastní hlava, se mýlí. Jakýkoliv fyzický kontakt s tebou je úplně nejúžasnější věc. Máš úžasné rodiče a moc fajn rodinu. Vaříš přesně podle mého gusta. Škoda, že hrát na klavír jsem tě slyšel jen přes telefon, je to pro mě nesmírně úctyhodné a máš mou nesmírnou poklonu.<br><br>Jen nejsi teď ta pravá pro mě. Máme jiné priority. Moje se hodně změnily za poslední měsíce, potřebuji podporu, jistotu, stabilitu, klid. Nechci drama, změny a problémy. Někdy je to naopak, teď tomu ale tak není. Dělej, co tě baví, buď otevřená možnostem. Važ si lidí, které máš kolem sebe. Nepodmiňuj lásku sama k sobě úspěchy nebo umístěními. Jestli jsi nejlepší sama pro sebe je čistě v definici.<br><br>Něco mezi vztahem a kamarádstvím není něco, co bych už někdy objevil, tím pádem to není něco, co by bylo jistotou, není to něco, co si bych teď přál. Potřebuji se ozdravit, dát se dokupy. Vím, že to chápeš a držíš mi palce.<br><br>Možná se naše cesty střetnou, dříve nebo později. Možná se potkáme. Určitě se oba změníme, možná pak budeme kompatibilnější. Jsme mladí, budeme úplně jiní. Život je šílená cesta, nechávám si otevřené možnosti, kam mne dovede, tam budu. Ale vím, co potřebuji teď. Už jsem to oplakal. Konečně cítím úlevu.<br><br>Pro nejúžasnější Anežku naposledy.<br>Farewell.<br><br>https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/playlist\/5APJfAlK5HNZWZ32RrALp8?si=atBlt6fVSsSRm7VZLOudKg&pi=KRdmUmdrR6iZn»","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1189,1166,1135,1158,1168,1176,1193],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30004,"minute":5,"hour":9,"day":25,"month":5,"year":2024,"datetime":1719299100000,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":5,"note":"beautiful cries ❤️","note_title":"","tags":[],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30005,"minute":0,"hour":20,"day":24,"month":5,"year":2024,"datetime":1719252000000,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":19,"note":"my god are we going to break up","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1185,1166,1124,1168,1176,1193],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30006,"minute":17,"hour":9,"day":24,"month":5,"year":2024,"datetime":1719213424145,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"at the doctor's, went to dermatology, right now at ENT, headed for blood draw 🩸 thinking about how my malaise intensifies after those beers or certain meals...like with the drinks it's pretty easy – quit drinking stupid carbonated drinks and drink...PLAIN WATER 💧 water is amazing and you do love it...but with meals...hmmm...you should cook your own...your immune system appears oddly sensitive, as does your pharynx, hard to say if it's just histamine mediated sensitivity or laryngopharyngeal reflux to some extent as well, it's all probably just very sensitive since EBV, but yeah, not that hard with the drinks is it...","note_title":"","tags":[1194],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30007,"minute":0,"hour":20,"day":23,"month":5,"year":2024,"datetime":1719165600000,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"we drove to get dad's new bike and that was... interesting, well I'm not an amazing driver but it's alright 😀 then two amazing walks so content with that! 🙌 felt fine but the non-alcoholic birrel made me feel bad...like the beer on friday...also basically reading all day long!","note_title":"","tags":[1189,1166,1158,1119,1168,1176,1193],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30008,"minute":51,"hour":20,"day":22,"month":5,"year":2024,"datetime":1719082316520,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"didn't sleep too well but the walk was great 😃 and the birthday party was fine 🫡","note_title":"","tags":[1189,1146,1166,1101,1158,1168,1176,1193],"assets":[353],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30009,"minute":57,"hour":21,"day":21,"month":5,"year":2024,"datetime":1718999840137,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"stupid STUPID alcohol I am not gonna drink that shit anytime soon again. aside from that?<br><br>brewery was lit 🙌 let's just say...my very... unoccupied...mind...has...had...some thoughts, and my...very...aloof... girlfriend...annoys the hell out of me 😃 with da boiz it was cool and home rest, and WHAT A WALK all the way round let's goo 🤑<br><br>in terms of health, I'm fine, I felt it after the beer, but otherwise alrighty, let's be careful...☀️<br><br>in terms of relationship, my god fuck it all 🤗 tomorrow if I may I wanna take a fucking walk like every fucking year when shit goes to hell with relationships 😃&nbsp;<br><br>Anežka fucks me up and I hate it, like I've reached the climax of how autonomous I can be while in a relationship, but my god if I'm going to be alone I might as well be fucking alone for real...not hoping for sex or some marvellous but oh so unlikely resolution... there's so many girls out there, my god is Anežka a lot of work now 🫡&nbsp;<br><br>I HATE how she knows stuff's wrong, something's bad, but she just doesn't give enough fuck to change it, like your health fucked? whatever. too much coffee? whatever. not enough sleep? whatever. hurting everyone around? whatever. the most fucking unhealthy relationship with school I've ever seen? whatever.&nbsp;<br><br>yeah yeah she knows things are horrible this way but she just thinks she can't change them...my god why<br><br><i>I don't wanna hurt you<\/i>. but you know what you missed? that it's an option, not an inevitability.&nbsp;<br><br>everything is your responsibility, everything is an option, to some fucking extent, and in this example, oh fuck yeah it's an option. you choosing to hurt me? oh I'm not of the people who'll just crawl back and cry, fuck off, if you spit I spit, of course.&nbsp;<br><br>I actually really like this feature of mine, just don't let people fuck around with you, no no no, you are NOT going to screw with me.<br><br>if you're tired?

Už je mi lépe, o poznání, a moc se mi líbí chodit do školy na třetí hodinu, dopoledne prokecat, odpoledne prospat a večer prodiskutovat u večeře. Velmi klidné, velmi příjemné.<br><br>Když mi v září začalo být nevolno, paní Eretová mi řekla, že bych měl přestat hledat biologický důvod a raději si odpočinout a nestresovat. Nyní, po 9 měsících, vím, že měla pravdu, a kdybych si býval odpočinul tehdy, nezreaktivovala by se mi mononukleóza do takové míry, do jaké k tomu došlo. Byl to post-akutní infekční syndrom, taková viróza s dlouhým ocasem, se říká, a kdybych si býval odpočinul, ušetřil bych si mnoho trápení. <br><br>Hodně jsem uvažoval nad školou. Obzvláště v souvislosti s Anežkou, pro ni je totiž škola a hlavně známky mimořádně důležité. Nemohu tvrdit, že pro mne historicky nikoliv, jelikož jsem poslední tři roky měl samé jedničky. Ale pravdou je, že za jakou cenu. Vždyť já kdybych se měl učit na zkoušení fyziky tak jen abych Vás nezklamal... Asi se na samé jedničky vykašlu...<br><br>Také jsem uvažoval nad svým budoucím studiem a jsem z toho jelen. Za poslední měsíce se mi velmi zalíbilo zpracovávat publikace a doplňovat Wikipedii, většinou se ale jednalo o biochemii\/bioinformatiku\/farmaceutiku. Paradoxně jsem si včera uvědomil, že daleko více rozumím molekulární biologii než fyzice. Prostě k tomu tak nějak došlo, nejprve jsem se musel vyléčit z akné, pak z mononukleózy, a v tom procesu jsem se zcela přirozeně naučil základy biochemie, organické chemie, bioinformatiky, programování, molekulární biologie, virologie a imunologie. <br><br>Myslel jsem, že bych v Chemnitzu studoval nějakou aplikovanou fyziku. Ale nyní nevím, v Deggendorfu mají bioinformatiku, mají ji i na VŠCHT a upřímně mě ten obor nesmírně láká. Když vidím ty předměty pod ním zapsané, jsem z toho nadšení. Půl počítače, půl biochemie. Táta říká, že bych neměl přidávat palivo své hypochondrii, nevím, když mě to tak zajímá všechno. S fyzikou mám tu potíž, že ji už zkrátka mimo své rybníčky působnosti nerozumím, nikdy jsem nedosáhl takové proeficience diferenciálních rovnic, abych ji rozuměl. Nemám na to hlavu, nikdy jsem neměl. Chápu to, rozumím tomu, ale moje hlava raději umí pět jazyků a vyjmenuje typy leukocytových receptorů, nežli pochopí kalkulus.»","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1189,1226,1166,1135,1182,1183,1124,1127,1101,1186,1168,1170,1176,1193],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30029,"minute":7,"hour":21,"day":4,"month":5,"year":2024,"datetime":1717528020149,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"hello my sweet earthlings, I just can't get enough<br><br>fine day, I slept a bit less than I should have so my health wasn't excited, but the examination was fine and the day in general was spent translating the cfs article on wikipedia and filling all the info in, which is a good deed 🙂‍↕️ nice but a bit tired walk (better than yesterday) and all in all thinking about Anežka a LOT, like A LOT 🤭 wrote another 2300 word essay about her","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1189,1166,1135,1183,1124,1127,1101,1154,1158,1108,1168,1170,1176,1193],"assets":[349],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30030,"minute":14,"hour":21,"day":3,"month":5,"year":2024,"datetime":1717442048125,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"well well well 🤗 fine day, good sleep, meh weather, amazing kebab lunch and fine wikipedia edits ✍️ call with honzík and a tired walk, great nap 😴 and to bed early","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1189,1166,1135,1183,1124,1127,1144,1158,1170,1193],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30031,"minute":43,"hour":21,"day":2,"month":5,"year":2024,"datetime":1717357400480,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":2,"note":"very rainy today but two things made it great 🤭 I had so much fun editing wikipedia, yes I did and yes I love it so much ahhh ❤️ and visit at grandma's making her TV finally work – yes bought her a chromecast 🙂‍↕️ no walk today but good, felt mostly fine throughout the day, some mildish vasal syncope symptoms, but otherwise quite quite good 😊","note_title":"","tags":[1189,1166,1101,1144,1170,1171,1193],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30032,"minute":30,"hour":22,"day":1,"month":5,"year":2024,"datetime":1717273822382,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":2,"note":"tense tense tense but formidable walk and the talk 🙏 it was needed...and lovely football in the afternoon, I'm giving this an orange! 🧡","note_title":"","tags":[1189,1185,1166,1228,1101,1158,1171],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30033,"minute":0,"hour":20,"day":31,"month":4,"year":2024,"datetime":1717178400000,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"good thing I slept in, school was exhausting, at Anežka's the atmosphere was rather tense and I topped it off with some horrible words at midnight, what a day 🤦‍♂️","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1189,1185,1166,1135,1228,1170,1171,1175,1193],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30034,"minute":33,"hour":21,"day":30,"month":4,"year":2024,"datetime":1717097588404,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1189,1166,1135,1158,1170,1171,1193],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30035,"minute":20,"hour":20,"day":29,"month":4,"year":2024,"datetime":1717006851419,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"tutoring and...trying? to learn","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1189,1166,1135,1193],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30036,"minute":0,"hour":20,"day":28,"month":4,"year":2024,"datetime":1716919200000,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"helping majda with school 🏫","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1189,1166,1135,1193],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30037,"minute":40,"hour":22,"day":27,"month":4,"year":2024,"datetime":1716842450559,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":2,"note":"<ul><li>had a really great time learning social sciences 😎<\/li><li>everyone was wonderful at school...the principal deputies basically told me to chill out 😊<\/li><li>act of kindness helping an old lady with her baskets 😌<\/li><li>walk was brill and passionate 🥰<\/li><li>Anežka on Friday!! ❤️<\/li><\/ul>","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1189,1166,1135,1124,1127,1158,1168,1176,1193],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30038,"minute":27,"hour":21,"day":26,"month":4,"year":2024,"datetime":1716751643483,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":2,"note":"cleaned a lot, calls with grandma and honzí, lovely lovely lovely learning and feeling fine 😌","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1189,1166,1168,1170,1171,1176,1193],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30039,"minute":0,"hour":20,"day":25,"month":4,"year":2024,"datetime":1716660000000,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"<keep>&lt;keep&gt; started with good sleep and packing.

In the morning we went for a trip to the peninsula between Cala Millor and Sa Coma, which was really nice. We came back with 13k steps again and after the brief lunch and nap around 16h we set off to Sa Coma beach. Mustn't forget my phone needed a wipe due to an update, so that made the whole experience quite unpleasant.

protection, well what a smart boy I was having packed it into my wallet just a couple of hours ago for the <i>just in case, <\/i>of course I had only one but this time...it sufficed and I was kinda hard enough so why not, carefully I pulled in and we only ended up having sex for like a minute, but it was much better than the previous time, it probably hurt her less and as we talked all of our troubles through there was no fear of mutual disappointment, we just focused on the enjoyment and I think that it worked out in the end...🥰<br><br>we then lay in bed for a couple of hours more because why not, yes we continued with our previous activities, more like me doing her which I so so so enjoyed, she was even so kind she went like \"but don't you miiiiind?\" because she thought that as I wasn't getting anything out of it I wouldn't find it pleasurable, well pleasurable it was, my fingers were a bit tired but pleasurable it was 🥰 I kept asking if it didn't hurt and she was frank and told me on every occasion it did, so we could make the best out of it ❤️ we also talked about stuff like the last time and all and I reckon that discussion was remarkable because it was so honest.<br><br>well we slept for some three hours which I didn't mind and in the morning we spend another 5 hours upstairs, we did similar stuff but she insisted that I have something out of it as well, so...observation bullet list time<br><ul><li>getting hand under a sweater and then carefully pressing and releasing appears to be a very enjoyable thing for both persons<\/li><li>kissing from month via neck to breast appears to be wonderful mate&nbsp;<\/li><li>when it comes to fingering it turns out faster and more is sometimes less, we tried both and both lead to climax, probably the best thing to do is start slowly and then when you feel it add a second finger or speed up, and then release, teasing a bit&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>alright so she insisted, and I was hard enough but unfortunately I didn't have another condom so that was a no go, instead she kept her underwear on while I more like <i>rubbed <\/i>avoiding penetration and then, when the time came, and that was the funniest thing ever, she said \"well you may come onto me and then we clean it\", which was awesome of course 😇 but after three ejaculations there was not particularly much to clean 🤣<br><br>so after noon we went downstairs and of course I was veeeeery ashamed because they must have heard at least&nbsp;<i>something <\/i>and simultaneously they knew I slept in there so...go figure 😆 Anežka had a very rough time walking after all that fun and my clothing was remarkably filthy so go figure they did 🤣 but yes downstairs we went and lunch we had while I talked with her dad about HVAC systems and electrical distribution 🤣 very good talks, he must have known... wonderful meal and on the sofa we sat like a metre away so funny 🤣 we wanted to go outside but still we stayed indoors in her room till it was dark, guess what we did 😆<br><br>then dinner which was very tasty over a very intellectual discussion while they had some friends come over so being introduced to them as well, driven back while her dad played veeeery sus music 😆 at home soon to bed 🥰<br><br>what a day.","note_title":"","tags":[1189,1185,1166,1228,1168],"assets":[327],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30187,"minute":0,"hour":20,"day":26,"month":0,"year":2024,"datetime":1706295600000,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":2,"note":"well

still, why not, so yes indeed we went by tram to the terminus and her dad there was in a car and I could not have foreseen how much he would resemble uncle Richard, just so much 🤣 he was a hilarious, uninhibited, candid and frank man who was remarkably friendly to me ❤️<br><br>well we arrived and there was Anežka's mum who was quite the person, she was a bit more reserved, but an incredibly well-meaning and kind-hearted lady, who was nothing but lovely to me 🥰 I also saw Šimon and the discussion we had over dinner was quite the fun hahahah I got quite the stomach ache as I ate too much, but nevermind, that was fine, I went to the loo and then...<br><br>well we stayed downstairs wanting to watch a movie, so we did and it was hilarious,<i>&nbsp;Dům za všechny prachy,<\/i>&nbsp;it was called and it was marvellous...but obviously even more marvellous was the person by my side and that was Anežka, whom I kissed and kissed and kissed so passionately over and over again, I found it to be quite joyful to sneak my hand under her sweater and just hold her breast...also quite remarkable was when I kissed her from her mouth down to her breasts and that was wonderful, just wonderful,

I went to thrash the used condom to the bin in two layers of socks lol<br><br>so we went to sleep and she fell asleep almost immediately while I dozed off for tops twenty minutes, well it was what it was I guess, while I was...thinking in bed I guess...I wondered if I'll get a chance to get all this right...when we woke up around eight, after tops two hours of sleep for her, we...kissed...and then we...not only kissed...I mean what a time, it went back to nightly vibes really quickly. I won't overdo it with the descriptions but it was wonder-wonder-wonderful, just so wonderful, we just lay there for two and a half hours again. I could have never imagined how romance blends into sexual desires, that is the way it ought to be. probably the hottest moment I recall was when in the morning, I gave her the phone to text her mum, and her mum responded with quite an irritated answer and instead of responding she chose to spend the time with me, and I said \"you should go there and be with your family\" and she responded with \"no, all I want you\", my heart melted. once we thought we were done, and it was after a while, I went to a convenience store to buy condoms, because we ran out. I also had many missed calls from my parents who, as it turned out, were very scared for me as they didn't know where I was, I answered the call and said I was fine, they found the address and everything... anyways, and I will never forget this, I opened the door and the sky was absolutely clear, azure blue, there was no wind, snow everywhere, temperature sub-zero. [CONTINUED IN EDIT] I walked for a while as it was quite far, I was a bit mad at myself for failing so miserably but what can one do, I hoped it would be better the second time. I bought the condoms and one can of coke, I walked and drank the coke, got back and what a view, she was there cooking lunch for me, my heart melted again, her in her cute yellow sweatshirt. I sat down onto a chair while insisting that I help her, she refused, she was not even going to eat anything! she cooked it just and just for me! we sat down and I enjoyed the meal, it was actually marvellous, we responded to the curious Honzí with how the night has turned out, not with too many details of course. she kept covering her mouth as she was probably embarassed for the puffy lips, but I couldn't care less.<br><br>it took me a while to finish the meal because I was not very hungry of course, she didn't even eat anything, well. we lay onto the sofa cuddling and spooning, very fun, I tried to sleep but of course I wouldn't fall asleep, doesn't surprise me. when she woke up we started kissing passionately again, no surprise, we both knew we'd end up upstairs... well, how did that turn out, slightly better than previous, but still I came in like 6 seconds (generous to myself here) and barely pulled in, what a shame, it was fun as we lay on each other naked in the blue sunshine. then we went under her blue blanket, we were both naked of course, and it was just cute. we held hands. I would gaze at her thinking to myself what a formidable woman she is. I asked her if she always chewed the gum to have a nice breath, she said she did it for this reason yes. funny. I was still in awe how wonderfully sexual it turned out to be, like that cute cute dirty talking about whatever, just being fun, \"křehká anežka\". still on my mind. we lay there for many hours, it was the most marvellous thing ever.<br><br>I'd leave at sunset, she wouldn't even walk out of her bed to part, she was that tired, we hugged, I was completely dressed up while she was completely naked covered in her blanket. parted like the old times, the times _before_. I went for the bus while the sun would dusk and it was formidable. I would be full of impressions for the rest of the day...probably days to come.<br><br>I still can't completely fathom how this all happened, how we went from something to cute to something so sexual so simply so effortlessly, unbelievable, so fluid, unbelievable. how everything just clicked and clicked and clicked. marvellous. just marvellous.","note_title":"","tags":[1185,1166,1228,1158,1168,1172,1175],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":30195,"minute":0,"hour":20,"day":19,"month":0,"year":2024,"datetime":1705690800000,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":2,"note":"well well well woke up without malaise but odd things go away so back to normality though an adorable walk undertaken and directly to the faculty, spilled the coffee onto my expensive keyboard but fun 🤣 felt illish though, as usual, persevered, also got the appointment, at school parliament and then direct to the driving school...not great not terrible, I'm a good driver but attention still my limitation 🤭<br><br>and then...to bageterie with honzík again discussing the realms of possibilities that could arise from the visit at anežka's, good times, he was saddish and I was not fortunately that ill, so we discussed the past of mine's and eda's and just chatted...<br><br>then met up with anežka and that's where another record begins...<br><br>[nsfw parts may follow, written in Spanish for discreetness] pues nos encontramos en la ciudad por la tranvía, estábamos esperando y esperando y bueno bueno y después llegó de repente... no puedo explicarte cuánto la amo ❤️ pues fuimos juntos a la estación del autobús y llegamos pronto, entonces tuvimos que esperar unos minutos pero no importaba, me sentía bastante bien, pues fuimos a su casa [changed back to english] while I explained the Monty Hall's Problem, first I took an inspection in the house, sort of looking and seeing for myself where there's what, well she showed me everything...there was a book about immunity and in that moment yes I felt malaise strongly...well we went on downstairs to prepare some meal, I was just casually helping with bringing stuff here and there while not being excellent at it 🫣 well she prepared the meal which was actually quite good but my shrunken stomach due to the...stress I guess...and malaise didn't really make it an option to eat it all...then we just sat...and looked at pictures, me got obsessed with june 2023 nostalgia...last time healthy?

Me siento un poco romántico, no sé porqué, pero sí me siento así, y más que nunca hoy, nosotros hablamos sobre el amor con mis amigos y creo que tienen razón, y yo con mi mismo también he hablado sobre eso y creo que tengo idea, tengo prospectos y tengo esperanza, de eso vamos a hablar pronto. Sólo es que la vida es muy normal recientemente, las caminatas me gustan tanto, la escuela me pone feliz y todo lo otro es solo mejor que nunca, estoy aprendiendo siempre algo y no pasa frecuentemente recientemente que no tuviera nada de hacer, siempre hay algo. Me acuerdo de cuando decía que no tengo suficiente tiempo, mira, es que el tiempo es muy relativo y no se puede decir tan fácilmente que significa no tener suficiente tiempo, en el día hay suficiente tiempo para hacer todo lo que tengo que hacer y un poco de lo que quiero hacer, suficiente. Es más importante que nunca que yo vaya a las caminatas, son lo más importante en mi vida, son el centro de todo lo que está pasando.&nbsp;<br><br><b>¿Qué me hace tener esperanza?<br><\/b><br>Cosas diferentes que antes, pero las cosas que escribí la última vez...sí me todavía dan esperanza. Pero recientemente hay dos cosas muy interconectadas, lo primero es mi acné, sabes que siempre me molestaba tanto, o sea, al veces no lo registro casi para nada, pero otros días muero del dolor y de la consciencia de verme, y eso, con tiempo se va a mejorar, porque probablemente y ojalá, vayamos a obtener remedios que en serio funcionan, y eso es importante, porque significa que la cosa que más me molestaba de todo va a desaparecer y creo que sí puedes entender que eso me hace pone tendiendo esperanza. Lo otro, muy conectado con lo otro, es que cuando voy a aparecer decentemente, mi autoestima se probablemente va a destoxicar y me voy a sentir mejor sobre él quién yo soy, y eso puede un día significar que tendré citas otra vez, sabes que hay una chica que sí me bastante gusta, hay preocupación por supuesto, pero un día, la voy a invitar para una cita, es que probar es lo que siempre sí es vale la pena, no puede perder casi nada. Quizá el amor verdadero me está esperando.<br><br><b>¿Qué me hace estar preocupado?<br><\/b><br>Hm, eso no es fácil de contestar, porque mis preocupaciones no hay mucho, mi cara no me gusta, pero todos esos preocupaciones del pasado, esos problemas abstractos, no los puedo ver no más.<br><br><b>¿Qué puedo aceptar que no puedo cambiar?<\/b><br><br>Que al veces escribiendo esos artículos no es totalmente perfecto, no se puedo sentir siempre perfecto, con cosas no mucho importantes no significa nada.

would the taste 🍯 then meet up with Pája and at 6:00 exactly we set en route, first I told him about my Monday, then we had some fun complaining about the construction works at the upper part of Myslinka 🏗️ then we just talked about how life is and we made it to train at around 6:48, solid three minutes before the train were to arrive 🚆so we got onboard, bought tickets, and made it to Pilsen Principal Station and there we basically sat and chilled ✌️ I read the news and then at 7:50 we had to super quickly rush to get tickets as I no longer could buy them by phone due to the train being late, yes, late, in the train we grabbed some photos and chilled and then had to reseat to Klatovy, I changed my clothes from uncomfy to supercomfy and we almost lost the ticket 🎫 but it was found yet again and we made it to Eisenstein, unfortunately, some 10 minutes too late and the German train had already left, so we crossed the border and snapped it 🇩🇪 then made some analogue photos in Germany and just walked through the city and were saying just how beautiful it is, soon we found ourselves on train to Deggendorf again, the weather was starting to get genuinely hot so most of this journey was chillling and almost sleeping while learning some German vocab with Anki 📱but then we arrived in Deggendorf, and here it went like wow, first some woman stopped us asking for directions and I for the first time in my lifetime used a new word I used \"geradeaus\", we walked through a park to the Danube 🏞️ and we dipped our feet in it, then we walked barefoot to the university of my choice - Deggendorf Institute of Technology 🎓 where I took a photo of me with the school and we also had our lunch there, it was pretty, we made photos 📸 then we set en route to the centrum of the city, walking barefoot was fun but we soon found a shopping mall and as the weather during noon was around 34° we unconsciously decided to stay there for quite some time, we refilled our water bottles 💧 and then went into an electronics store where I played with iPads, Pája played with camera and then we both played with the ANC headphones, at first the lady was telling us some stuff we couldn't understand, so we supposed \"put the shoes on\" would do, but then she showed us that we were supposed to put our backpacks into a cabinet to not walk with them around the store, a good choice indeed ✌️ so we had fun in the store, I think we spent some good hour there in the cool environment and just, it was great!, I may buy an iPad mini or iPad Air 2021, they look way too good so once my chromebook goes dead I may opt in for an iPad I suppose 🍎 alrighty after the store we set en route to the main square, there we walked across and visited a store, found a very charming young lady inside, I bought banana müsli sticks and Pája bought some pastry, I said \"kann ich mit mein' Handy zahlen?\" and the world didn't actually collapse due to not having used the dative case, huh, all this time in school they told me otherwise!, anyway, we made incredibly Bavarian photos with pretzels in front of Bavarian flags and it was awesome, then we walked through the town for some time and soon found ourselves on the main square again wanting to buy some souvenirs, so we did find them and I bought a magnet 🧲🖼️ and Pája bought some postcards, then we walked into a bookstore and we just looked at the books for some 30 mins again, awesome time there!, Pája bought conjugation for verbs and I bought nothing, but awesome anyway, so we walked to the city park in the biggest heat and there we are some food again, really good vibes walking in the city ⚡ then Pája wanted to take some analogue photos again so we headed in the direction of Danube, but turned and headed to the square for the third time, made photos and went to the train station, talking about how immensely long our stay there felt, bought some Apfel Schorle as the weather was super hot, and...train got 10 minutes late, we hoped we'd make it to the Czech one in Eisenstein on time – we didn't, so we walked from the border to the city, some solid three kilometres, absolutely starving for water, we got some and it was great, Czech train arrived 10 mins late again and the journey was 20 minutes longer than it should have been, but it was magical anyway, wonderful sunset 🌅 and head out the windows, arriving in Pilsen we decided we had nothing better to do than to walk to the Southern station and so we did, walking by my school in the meantime and then listening to German music, soon we got to Kozolupy and my dad was there. the end.\n\nthere could be so much more written down, so much more! just awesome

bylo krásné počasí, poté co jsem připravil snídani jsem se posadil v jídelně a učinil jsem asi jedno z nejdůležitějších rozhodnutí mýho života\n\nbabi mi včera říkala \"matysku, tebe je tady v naší republice škoda 👵\" no tak jsem googlil a googlil kde bych mohl jít na univerzitu\n\ntak nejlogičtější, nejracionálnější, řešení by bylo jít do německa, tak jsem otevřel databázi všech study programes který provozuje německá vláda a tak jsem si tam tak zadal že chci informatiku, ideálně Bavorsko et cetera a našel jsem úžasný studijní program v Deggendorfu, město 35 km od českých hranic a hlavně jen jeden vlak z Železný Rudy, teda jen dva vlaky do Plzně, program na umělou inteligenci, bakalář z vědy, všechno v angličtině – pokud budu chtít, koukal jsem na admission requirements a ten vstupní test obsahuje hrozně zajímavý věci, nejdřív je tam kalkulus (derivace integrace, to nás s Edou Randa začal vloni učit), pak základy statistiky (neumím nic) a pak informatika, a do informatiky spadají...a pozor...i jazyky, takže moje lingvistika konečně k něčemu bude!!, a pak jsou tam počítačový vědy a tam spadá Halting problem a mně se úplně nějak udělal úsměv na tváři když jsem zjistil že jsem před dvěma rokama koukal na video od Toma Scotta a že vlastně vím co to je a jak to funguje:3333\n\ntak jsem pak šel na procházku a přemýšlel jsem nad svou budoucností, a kromě toho že jsem se krásně prošel, jsem si musel pomyslně poplácat po rameni protože za poslední rok je to asi to jediný co mi do života dává nějaký směr, první jsem se poněkud rozesmutnil nad zjištěním že se musím nějak dostat z tohodle mentálního bordelu do tý doby, a nějak si v sobě vyřešit nějaký věci, ale já si myslím, že to se zařídí, že to si sedne, že bude zas dobře, včera jsem koukal na Young Sheldona a někde se ve mně vzala naděje že se to všechno snad zlepší, že jednou snad na tohle období budu koukat jako na trošku temnější, ale pořád neskutečně zásadní...afterall it's only when it rains that we grow...taaak to bylo dopoledne\n\npak jsem dělal salát, volal tátovi jestli můžu vzít okurky ze skleníku, pak jsme s Páťou obedvali, já si pak šel dáchnout protože mi bylo tak ospale, tak jsem asi půl hodinky spal a pak jsem asi hodinu na telefonu googlil Halting Problem abych se vzdělal, tak jsem se pak zvedl a šel jsem se posadit k počítači a začal jsem si zase dělat němčinu...s mou novou motivací žít v Německu...tak jsem si to dělal asi hodinu a neskutečně moc jsem si to užíval, fakt, ten hezkej sešit a prostě je to fajn se zas učit něco sám od sebe, pak jsem se zvedl a řekl jsem si že jsem moc dlouho seděl a šel jsem běhat...\n\na to bylo tak moc krásný, já jsem si řekl \"dneska dám 3 km\", což nezní jako nic náročnýho ik ale pro mě to prostě celkem náročný bývá, tak jsem si dal sluchátka do uší a prostě to nějak šlo, běžel jsem a běžel jsem... měl jsem radost protože jsem měl tep okolo 160 a to znamená hodně bodíků, pak mi to zavibrovalo že první kilometr 5min40s tak to mi taky udělalo radost, dobrý písničky do uší a za chvíli jsem byl doma, energii jsem si úplně perfektně rozložil a nakonec 5min6s, takže mega radost z toho, pak jsem si dal svůj zbytek těstovin se sýrovou omáčkou který jsem vařil na včerejší večeři ale udělal jsem toho moc, k tomu jsem si pustil polýmathy krásné půlhodinové video a to bylo krasnyyyyyyy, pak přijela mamka s tátou, dal jsem si ještě hodinu němčiny protože mě to tak moc bavilo a pak ještě procházka jednou a pak birell venku na zahradě tradiční a pak umejt se, stresovat se zítřejší cesty a here I

of the day: philosophical thoughts are like you remembering to swallow your saliva, or remembering to breath, you once ignite the thought and it's there, and it's there only because there is no other thought to push it away, your brain is like a computer that always needs to do something, when my brain has nothing to think of, I start talking about languages or thinking about life, give your brain something to think of and it won't ask for more, the sole reason you have so many thoughts is because you're capable of having them, learn some cybernetics, give yourself some good show to occupy your

bylo takový low key, nechtělo se mi nic dělat, prokrastinace, trošičku overthinking a utápění se v týhle životní fázi, přemýšlel jsem až moc prostě, znáš to... 🫥\n\npak ale prostě první procházka...fan-tas-tic-ký, úplně prostě ah, moc jsem si to užil, nakonec jsem přemýšlel nad nějakým algebraickým problémem a defacto řešil matiku jen tak pro zábavu, nádhera ✨\n\npak oběd kterej byl famózní, s rodinkou, táta nadhodil téma sebepoškozování protože se o tom bavili v hospůdce, tak jsem byl označen za to že to podporuju, když jsem jenom řekl že ty lidi potřebují pomoc a ne odsouzení, potom to Páťa obrátil na to aby nám všem řekl jak se mu hnusí homosexuálové, přičemž já jsem opět byl v opozici, Páťovi jsem řekl že by byla sranda kdyby mu osud dal že se mu líbí kluci 😅\n\npak mamka začala říkal jak Páťa vypadá jako gauner a že určitě bude promiskuitní jako dospělej a já jsem navrhl abysme ho nechali očkovat proti papilomaviru... tím bych ukončil oběd, ale bylo to fantastický ❤️\n\npo obědě jsem si sedl k počítači a vlastně jenom tak psal jak by vypadal můj ideální den, a přišel jsem na to že někdy ráno musím jít do školy pěšky, a že to někdy by mohla být tahle středa 🔥\n\npak jsem si řekl že by bylo krásný jít na další procházku...tak jsem šel, asi dvě a půl hodiny, úžasný to bylo, probral jsem si sám se sebou tolik věcí, exkurzi, ideální den, pár zajímavých poznatků, ale hlavně prostě neskutečně užitý to bylo... když na to teďka koukám tak někde uvnitř cejtim strach že tak krásnej den už nikdy nenastane, ale určitě nastane! ☀️\n\npo tom co jsem přišel domů jsem si psal s Edou, což bylo poměrně zajímavé, my si obvykle nepíšeme jen tak, ale teď to tak bylo, fascinující, pak jsem chvilku prokrastinoval TEDx talk nějakou, ale pak jsem se zvedl a šel jsem přepočítávat co mám v kasicce abych to odnesl do banky, to mi vedlo k nápadu to celý automatizovat v Pythonu, což mi vedlo k dvou hodinám strávených programováním 🧑‍💻\n\npak byla večeře...a po tom co mamka s Páťou odešli se mi prostě táta zeptal na to co se teďka děje, vyslechl si příběh o celé exkurzi, morální dilemata, pana Randu... neříkal jsem mu detaily o nás dvou protože na to se ani neptal, ale nijak bych to stejně netajil, táta ví jak moc tě mám rád... poskytl mi jinej pohled na věd a vyslechl si to všechno, tak to mi udělalo moc moc radost, hrozně moc si toho vážím

was...well not as good as yesterday, and then she left, and then she came again and she fell asleep here, and that made me happy, but then she left again as Eda came back to go to sleep here, well that was the night\n\nhow much have we slept? 5 hours, yep, it's fucked, 5 goddamn hours despite being sick, that's the biggest shit you could've done matt.\n\nso what are the reasons we're sad now?\n\nnumber one, lack of sleep, it causes you to be emotionally unstable, you should've slept more and you know it\n\nnumber two, we're still sick, we still have a goddamn common cold, we still do have a runny nose, we still have an increased body temperature, we still have a bit of a sore throat, yes\n\nnumber three, social events, a lot has happened recently here yeah? sometimes the world is just happening faster than you'd wish and you just can't for the love of god keep up with it\n\nnumber four, our relationship, we're not sad as something bad would be going on, we had so many cute moments yesterday, it's just that when I'm sad I get insecure and when I'm insecure my insecurities considering our differences et cetera cause me to be sad even more\n\nnumber five, that's all the rest\n\nso what do we do?\n\nlet's just somehow make it today yeah? you'll come home by 20:00 and you'll just fall asleep asap and I'm sure, keep sleeping until you feel like not wanting to do so anymore, if you wonder about whether or not you should go to work, don't, don't give a fuck about the consequences, try to not give a fuck, do your herbal on sunday, rest on saturday, try to meet up with your old friend, enjoy some walks, enjoy some ukulele, enjoy some spanish, enjoy some family time, enjoy some of all these goodies, it's enough to make a grown man happy yeah? then on monday make it to school, and have a normal time there yeah? don't fuck anything up, just have a fine time, enjoy some labs and also after school have some romance time, if possible repeat on tuesday because you need it, on wednesday, oh wednesday, spanish is on our daily menu, give everyone these cute postcards and see what happens yeah? well that's the near future if you ask me, far-wise, enjoy june with all it's goodies, when july comes, make time for what matters, romance, family, friends, hobbies, also do a bit of work yeah? don't overdo it, just let it be, then enjoy england, you know, that's gonna be goddamn crazy, but I bet you'll love it, despite your current insecurities, the relationship is beautiful isn't it ✨ just live on, make a healthy sleep habit, make a healthy ukulele habit, you know, I think you indeed should learn it, there indeed is some resistance now to doing do, mainly as you feel pressure to do so perhaps, but she's right that you would enjoy it a ton, you know, you wanted someone to tell you what to do to be happier, someone told you what to do to be happier, well give it a try yes dear? also try to cook from time to time, take frequent walks because that's something you quite frankly love, and learn...a language? or a science? whatever you feel like, make s decision of what you want to study, it's time matt 🙏 and keep on spending time together, you love her and you know it, and she probably loves you as well, so stop making it bad just because of your insecurities yeah dear? not everyone has to be sad just because you are, maybe your head is still a mess, maybe still you're going through a tough phase of life, so let it be and live on I beg you dearly\n\nalso here's some stuff you forget rather often, you're awesome 👏 you're really smart, you speak three languages fluently, you are really good at physics, astronomy, maths, computer, you name it, perhaps not biology but when it comes to hard sciences, you name it 👏 you're a really good person, you're awesome it that aspect, you treat everyone right, you treat your friends right, you treat your family right, you treat your love right, which is important 👏 so here's the last thing, fortune favours the brave, so be brave, do things and trust yourself that you're doing what you shall be doing, don't overthink life, life's simple, there's not much else to it than you've got, you're not missing anything, important observation made in mallorca, there's not a point after which one just would be happy, no, life is a continuum, you change, your mental status changes, your hobbies change, don't judge yourself on changing, changement de valeurs, everyone grows to be exactly the person they should be, try new things and seek.\n\nfortune favours the

of me that I think that their family is so chaotic, I was worried about what they think about me and they are worried about what I think of them, what do I think of them? they are wonderful people!

well as I'm gonna walk her to the bus, tomorrow I'll see her in the morning, friday we'll go to lunch, saturday maybe I could encounter her in the city and sunday probably nothing, but that's not

came, his gal left as they were running late, but my gal had to tell me she forgot the phone today, we hugged and I smiled as always 🍃 then had history which was just fine, and czech which was pretty nice actually, didn't mind that one, the teacher's a good fellow, then english and that one was good, enjoyed, then chemistry which I didn't mind but didn't love either, then lunch which we all had together and I was in quite a bad mood for some reason, I don't know why, but I was...well I missed the jokes and wasn't as kind as I should be, the lunch was good and the walk was fine as well, just I wasn't that talkative, then physical education (aka PE) which was...at first I felt that it may not get too great, but it did, we played football and I did one goal, I suck at football, but I loved it, the other half of the lessons I was on the rotoped and I did some decent 7 kilometres, it felt good, we listened to some music and I was feeling just kinda happy, well then after having good talks with all the people I love I was like \"I've got too much time on my hands now, maybe I could ask love if I can go just as a company with her\" \n\nand so I did, I asked her, \"I've got way too much time on my hands, may I go with you?\" and she was like \"of course\", so I went to the bathroom and after a year of bladder shyness I managed to pee while other...pisoars where in use, by my friends so it worked, shouldn't be that happy because of it, but I kind of am 🍃 so I went in front of the school and we met and we got to hold hands and we went, and I told her I was sorry for being not a great company over with the lunch, and she said \"you know, when you have a bad mood all you do is talk less, you're not like bad\", and that made me feel good, sometimes I feel like I'm too bitter when I'm in bad mood, but I'm glad she doesn't think so ✨ and we went and it was cute, got to the tram, went by the tram, hugged, said goodbye, I said \"I can't just leave now without giving you a kiss\", so we kissed, and I left and we waved at each other for the last time and we smiled both...made me smile really 🥰\n\nnow I'm sitting by the riverside waiting for my interview... we'll see man!

(⚡), from which one could be pregnant so we talked about how life'd work, then I had to go to the dentists where I yet again spent just a couple of minutes, my teeth are fine, still unsure about whether or not I should get braces, they aren't cheap, then music where we at first were bored but at the end it was quite pretty, then we had our traditional physics lesson which turned out to be so interesting, Mr. Randa literally talked to me about his personal life (⚡) and I'd have talked more were there not for Lukáš with whom it's a complicated story, but basically I realised that it's not worth getting him mad, he probably saw what her nickname in my phone is and maybe that made him a bit upset, but you know what, I'm not really even sorry, I understand that you were probably thinking that something'd happen, but noone promised you anything and man, if she doesn't want you, well what can you do, I know the feeling man, happened to me way too many times! 😐\n\nso after all that I went on to get home by train which led to me running as I was running late, but eventually made it in literally 5 minutes, walk home was interesting as I talked spanish and it was really exhausting, I got kinda hanged off reality, made it home, learned that my brother got a 4 from maths so I just had to help him, I did, I went on a walk with dog and got a phone call from the BigBurger people,

we're doing just fine, kinda in pensive mood but that's fine, let's give here some thoughts!\n\nI read some daylio records from last oct October and I've got thoughts, we spent basically Q4 searching for happiness didn't we, and we kept convincing ourselves that we've found it didn't we, Q4 was incredibly interesting, mainly as we really really got into a completely different person than we were, first question, were we sadder than we are now? we were, I believe we were sadder, as we were just kinda overthinking happiness. I'm firm believer that the person back then was just not-so-me, he did things I don't believe I enjoy, he tried to be friends with people I don't really believe he wanted to be friends with\n\nthis era had it's highest moment with our crazy walk, that was the peak, of all the habits of all the self-help, and you know what was a main contributing factor to the decline? spanish, it was the vision of spanish that led to an end, we realised that chilling by the sea sounds just a bit better than reading all day long, and then the era ended, January 27th around 9:00, why back then you ask? because priorities shifted, from self-help to romance, and then it went like.\n\nso, another thought, was I ready for romance? I mean, I kept saying I was ready for it, but was I? I mean, nobody asked me if I wanted it or didn't, the feelings just...came, but I believe I've had a misconception about what romance was about to come and what it was gonna be like, you know, sometimes I wonder, if I'm ready for this all, my heart is a mess, sometimes I feel stuff I shouldn't and sometimes when I should feel stuff I don't, examples? lasergame always made me immensely happy, this time it didn't, beginning to go out with someone should have made me immensely happy, but it kinda didn't, so what did make me happy in the past week? couple of notes of happiness, sunday shopping felt good, tuesday dancing felt amazing, wednesday evening felt really good, thursday walk felt really good and not gonna lie thursday evening and friday morning both were really cool, forget not friday evening walk which felt really good too.\n\nyou know, here's another thing I noticed, your mood in the present moment has incredible impact on how you reflect on the past, and also, thinking about whether or not you're happy makes you less happy.\n\nanother fascinating thing, I've got everything I've ever wanted, family - ✅, friends - ✅, hobbies - ✅, romance - ✅, identity - ✅, just everything seems to be a check, but still it just seems like I could be happier. ah, why?\n\nso what are we gonna do now? we'll let see where the paths will go, mainly keep loving your girl, keep loving those family dinners, keep dreaming of spain, and stop overthinking happiness. deal?","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1188,1168,1175],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31206,"minute":1,"hour":21,"day":16,"month":3,"year":2022,"datetime":1650135719610,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"after physics went outside and didn't get anything done, but nice call with grandma (⚡) and quite a nice dinner with family (⚡)\n\nnot a day I'll remember, not a day I'd want to forget","note_title":"","tags":[1189,1166,1192,1158,1168,1175],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31207,"minute":50,"hour":14,"day":16,"month":3,"year":2022,"datetime":1650113427707,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"only home, but got some rest and also...the messages from her are kinda...personal now 🍃\n\nI don't want to get too deep into messages, but she literally said she fell in love ✨\n\nnow gotta do some physics I guess 🔧","note_title":"","tags":[1166,1175],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31208,"minute":0,"hour":20,"day":15,"month":3,"year":2022,"datetime":1650045600000,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":2,"note":"my goodness ✨\n\nwoke up around 7:30, meh sleep to be honest, but had a pretty morning with my grandparents, also she texted me that she slept over which I was completely fine with, I mean, at least you had a good night's sleep<33 then went to the train station and waited for her, got myself a coffee and helped some strangers, felt good, then met up with her and just we went tired together by the tram, then the walk, which was very pretty, we talked about basically nothing, in between she did tell me some cute things but the important thing happened when we got back ✨\n\nso yes we met up with my parents and had a nice lunch and then I showed her around the house which was kinda magical (⚡), we went to the horse place and waited together and it was kinda pretty (⚡) and then she did horse riding and my mum was really happy, we made it quickly back home and my dad took us to the bus station, we had some pretty moments there, she had her head on my shoulder and I gave her like three kisses, she also told me that I don't have to ask 😆 so we said our goodbyes and that was it.\n\nthen I went to the work meetup which was pretty nice actually, me and my friend we got a place and yeah it's gonna be alright!

I feel amazed and puzzled, I feel being put to thinking, but overall ... I feel happy, in the present moment a bit confused, but in the past day I am happy, I did so much today, I spent the day quite wisely.\n\nbrings back memories to the march for example, remember? you started daydreaming, you called it \"deep mind state\" or \"deep thinking\", what it really was was just you playing a role in your own imagination, and no ... before you get excited it was not some sort of a perfect imagination like the movie you just saw, it was barely enough to keep it running without a halt, but it worked. You imagined what the skiing course will have been like, you were so wrong just about the conditions under which it would happen, but that is okay, remind me in about a month and a half to remind you of all the things you though just wrong about.\n\nBut deep thinking (or whatever you want to call it) was really quite cool, you were the opposite of present, you were the opposite of mindful, you were not even in this world by thoughts, but it didn't matter, there was no lag in coming back, no matter ± few days, it would still be the same. You had nothing in reality to keep you engaged, so you kept yourself engaged on your own. Not like now, where the return to reality feels slightly overwhelming, or back in August when you stepped outside that cinema and felt so behind the world, back then there was nothing to get behind of, time was passing slowly.\n\nThis also kinda brings back memories to some of my lucid dreaming experiments, they were really interesting after all.\n\nThis year was really cool man, let's get back a bit from all the philosophy 😌\n\nIf you were to come back to the beginning of 2020, what would you tell yourself? What did you hoped would come trues came true, what didn't, and what that came true you didn't even hope for?\n\nFirstly, romance ❤️\n\nRomance was ... interesting this year. I had essentially only three real crushes (to have a crush ≈ platonically liking): \n\nNela, with her the crush was really just not that platonic, because she was amazing as a person, I still wish I'd somewhere with her sometime.\n\nThen there was the girl whom name you did not even know, I mean, this crush was weird, it was platonically very strong, but it like didn't move aaaanywhere. I still sometimes say \"dangggg ... hot\" when I see her, but that's probably just out of habit or idk 😅\n\nAnd then there was Markéta, I mean, this was strong. Started out strong and ended up pretty intense still, you have a ton of data about this relationship literally everywhere so I won't bother with details. I'm just ... glad we've actually gone on that date I guess 😂\n\nIn the end, romance this year was kinda exhausting and boring at the same time, I had 0 girlfriends this year, same as the year prior, but I guess that is not all that bad, I had my fun.\n\nRight now my relationship\/crush situation is ... complicated to say the least. I'm currently \"dating\" Ada Raichlova and honestly that is just so great, we always have such a nice time together and I honestly just so enjoy it everytime. But it's new to me as I never really liked someone and not had them as a crush at the same time. You wonder what is the difference? I just kinda don't feel butterflies, I don't redden up whenever I see her, I don't avoid her out of fear while trying to meet her out of curiosity, I know her, and she knows me, when I see her and remind myself of the fact that we went on \"dates\", I don't shiver, I don't feel like that should not have happened. The difference is that I just feel that she, the person I meet sometime at school, is exactly the person I know so well, exactly the person I've gone on dates with. To give it to perspective, once Nela sat next to me during lunch this June and I shivered when I realised that I had asked her out, I just felt like that must have been a difficult, but that was not the case.\n\nWhen I'm actually thinking about it, this seems ideal? No real platonic feelings, just liking?

I got ready for the trip and by 8:05 I began by journey to Kozolupech Train Station ☺️\n\nI got to the train station by 8:50, about 10 minutes before the train was ought to arrive, I had a magical idyllic moment here, when I was waiting while reading and I felt so calm 🍃 This moment generated satisfaction with life 😇\n\nThe train journey was pretty good! I sat down and read a bit, then I just kept looking out of the window, as the scenery was simple beautiful 👌\n\nBy 9:45 I arrived to my destination station and immediately began my trip, I turned on GPS tracking and began! The village seemed so calm, exactly as calm as the last time I was there - summer 2020, this moment generated inner peace 🕊️\n\nAnd so I walked, first 5 km I had the energy to talk and I summed up a good portion of September, this ended with me having to cross a little water spring, where the \"bridge\" was just a log over water with another log as a railing, I feared what would I have done if I had fell, but thankfully I didn't have to learn that the hard way and so I continued on my journey 💕\n\nAfter I walked and walked on the hiking red path I got onto a road and I walked again, but then I got a really memorable moment for me as I got to see a wonderful view of a highlands plateau, it was kilometres of empty fields interrupted only by huge high voltage power lines, after a few kilometres more I got into my first village, where it felt again so silent and calm, then I walked through the forest a bit concerned about the wildhunt signs, even though they said the hunts take place from 16h to 10h and it was 11:30, boy I was a bit afraid, but generally fine ☺️\n\nThe second village I encountered was a very unpleasant one, a dog kept barking at me while it was getting closer and closer to me, I pretended to not care, but I was scared, at some point he was only 10m from me 🤐 This moment generated fear and adrenaline 😅\n\nAfter this I continued to walk as usual on the cyclopath until it ended, then I walked across field paths and fields in general, that though made only a small part of the trip 😅\n\nThe first town I encountered was called \"Erpužice\" though I kept calling it \"Epstružice\", it had the small town vibes and again it felt really calm, I was bit worried as the people seemed awkward but generally ok 👍\n\nAfter about 500m from the borders of Erpužice I got to walk very close to its airstrip so I have got pretty good photos! 👍\n\nNot too much further some kind guy just stopped and asked whether I didn't need to get somewhere, in hindsight I feel as if I were a bit mean, but this was a really kind moment, even more considering the absolutely breathtaking views of the plateau 🍃\n\nAfter this I passed through one more village and it didn't take long until I got within reach of \"the bridge\" which was kinda the breaking point of the trip, as it was in about a half, what happened though is that the entry there was prohibited (to the area around the bridge) due to a hunt, so I actually walked by the rails instead of the forest paths and I did make it to the bridge, but I was really afraid I have to admit, I had a small lunch on the opposite side of the river as I was afraid of staying on the other side 😬 This moment again made me afraid and filled with fear 😅\n\nThough this fear didn't end by crossing the bridge really, I met some people which made me feel assured that everything is fine, but that was kinda false sign, because as I proceeded through the wilderness I encountered many more huntsmen and heard many more gunfires 😬\n\nIt didn't take long until I reached the highest point of my trip and a few moments later I was crossing the main road, I saw many cars there, so that made me worry a bit, my fears proved true as soon as I got into the forest where I was a huntsman who indicated to me that I shall leave this area quickly, no signs anywhere whatsoever 😅 At first I wanted to just go around, but after encountering one more huntsman I decided that I would go on the main road, because only that seemed to actually avoid the hunting area 😅\n\nWell, it was not a very pleasant experience to walk about 3 kilometres on the main road where cars drove with speeds up to 100 km\/h, but eventually I got into Úlice 👍\n\nThis part of the trip I felt actually the lowest I think, as I had no idea of how to get home, I wanted to avoid the forest at all costs but I also refused to walk kilometres more on a dangerous road, so I decided to walk on a field 😅\n\nMost of the field was a grassed one so one could walk pretty well, but then it changed to a plowed field and that was a lot harder to walk on, I had to run and jump while trying to not get my shoes too dirty 😅\n\nBut eventually I did make it to the pathway I was supposed to originally take and there I felt a relieve, I drank some water and just proceeded ❤️\n\n🎵 ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE by Quinn XCII 🎵\n\nIt's all about the scenery along the route 🙏\n\nWell so I walked and walked, made it above my home village, had a cookie which tasted worse than I expected, but after a few more minutes I found myself home 🏠\n\nWhile I was taking my shoes of I overstretched the muscle on my left leg, but as my tolerance towards pain became quite strong, yh it hurt, but I just ceased to care 😅\n\nI showered and popped a bloody blister that got made on my pinky finger on my left foot, I replied to all my messages, and then I fell asleep, it took a few moments, but I did fall asleep 😇\n\nOnce I woke up I played the song from Quinn XCII and watched the news with mum, I had dinner and then I made smoothie, wrote a bit of poetry and watched a bit of stardance 💪\n\nI actually turned out to have enough energy to do my daily exercising (I wanted to tick it anyways because it was pretty hardcore today) and I did the full 15 mins, then 10 mins of meditation and the day was done 😇\n\nI wanted to read but after writing so many paragraphs I won't, I'll go straight to sleep 🙏\n\nToday was kinda crazy, I walked 38.4 km and did 47 315 steps, this is the record for the longest continuesly walked distance and it comes only second as an overall walked distance 👌\n\nReally good day.

Even I used to play some from time to time, let's be honest, but I couldn't anymore, I just had those feelings of extreme sadness afterwards, I wrote final rules into \"the morals of self pleasure\", tell me whatever, but I've been lying to myself for a long time, I told myself that all self pleasure is bad, porn is bad and all is bad and I felt bad doing it, though porn is something for which the feeling afterwards does outweights the feeling beforehand.\n\nI just can't do it, and most guys do, I know, I don't judge them, but to me, the dopamine just doesn't feel as oxytocin, and yh exploiting body's dopamine reward system is cool, but the warm feeling in your heart telling you someone cares for you is a billion times more valuable to me than some dopamine..\n\nI'm asking for love, I sound crazy, I may be too romantic, but I'm asking for love.\n\nMaty z budoucnosti sounds the phrase, I know that love is not always perfect, and that it requires effort, and that it requires to be cared for, how long did it take, until you met this kind of perfectly imperfect love?\n\nI'm ready for a relationship, I hope, I know I am backwards compared to my peers, but I don't care.\n\nPlease let there be someone for me.\n\nPlease take this wish in the least selfish manner possible, I try not to be so selfish, selfishness is the awfulmost thing or myself I know of.\n\noxytocin.","note_title":"","tags":[1154,1131],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31620,"minute":15,"hour":22,"day":12,"month":10,"year":2021,"datetime":1636751710422,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":2,"note":"The space between us <3333","note_title":"","tags":[1192,1101,1154],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31621,"minute":36,"hour":19,"day":12,"month":10,"year":2021,"datetime":1636742182664,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":3,"note":"","note_title":"","tags":[1146,1175],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31622,"minute":19,"hour":12,"day":12,"month":10,"year":2021,"datetime":1636715954839,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":3,"note":"how is it that a walk always makes me feel better 🍃","note_title":"","tags":[1158],"assets":[149],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31623,"minute":4,"hour":11,"day":12,"month":10,"year":2021,"datetime":1636711490089,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":4,"note":"tired","note_title":"","tags":[],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31624,"minute":54,"hour":10,"day":12,"month":10,"year":2021,"datetime":1636710894711,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":3,"note":"yhhhh, feeling fine, probably gonna go for a short walk now, also, I've got no book to read now, as \"because internet\" has not been delivered yet 📚","note_title":"","tags":[],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31625,"minute":57,"hour":7,"day":12,"month":10,"year":2021,"datetime":1636700243840,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":2,"note":"","note_title":"","tags":[1131],"assets":[148],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31626,"minute":31,"hour":7,"day":12,"month":10,"year":2021,"datetime":1636698684467,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":4,"note":"meh sleep","note_title":"","tags":[1175],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31627,"minute":45,"hour":21,"day":11,"month":10,"year":2021,"datetime":1636663555594,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":3,"note":"finished digital minimalism 📚\n\nnot feeling for a summary really, hopefully you'll do without it :)","note_title":"","tags":[1101],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31628,"minute":30,"hour":21,"day":11,"month":10,"year":2021,"datetime":1636662626459,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":2,"note":"the first second after one opens their eyes, one cannot describe it, it's just so cool 🍃","note_title":"","tags":[1184],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31629,"minute":18,"hour":18,"day":11,"month":10,"year":2021,"datetime":1636651090938,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":3,"note":"after my daily dose of exercise 💊","note_title":"","tags":[1166,1192],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31630,"minute":56,"hour":13,"day":11,"month":10,"year":2021,"datetime":1636635374981,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":2,"note":"We waited in the queue with Verča, Eda, Martin & Sabča and it was nice!

It was a really good dream that's what I remember, it almost was like an action movie.\n\nalso I remember having a vision in the first dream (maybe I've already had this dream once, but this dream was about how once at my grandma's there was no staircase and it was literally just paper boxes stacked on top of each other, and I remember saying how I went all the way to Adam Benedikt's saying it was absolutely crazy how it felt to stand on hundreds of these paper boxes. \n\nalso, I remember having to save some little girl in one of such dreams, don't know which one it was though, also, in one of the dreams I remember my other grandma Eva participating, though again, I don't remember the actual dream.\n\none other thing to know is that I woke up around 3:50 in the night as I again had a wet dream (yep, awesome...), do yh I changed my clothes, but the important thing is that once I was starting to fall asleep again, I again got into that half-concious half-dreaming state, so that was pretty cool\n\nI also kinda remember what caused my wet dream, even though the memory is kinda blurry now, it was something that we were at the summerhouse, and my grandma and mum were talking about how energies are so expensive nowadays (don't know why they were talking about that either), I remember then going into the kitchen and closing myself in there, and literally googling some porn or what, don't know, only thing I remember was that there was a \"whitelist\" toggle in the search engine 😂 I came even before I found any \"video\" and that was about it, I remember then, don't know really when, I \"dreamed\" about \"how to have anal sex\" god knows why, it was weird definitely, I was in that half-half state I think and I have no idea why I had dreamed about that 🤷🏼‍♂️\n\nthat was about it, there was one more dream, kinda inappropriate, about human anatomy, that was weird, but I don't want to go into the details 😅\n\noverall, I think I slept very well, I'm gonna make myself tea and gotta do a little work!\n\nnice morning!","note_title":"","tags":[1155,1152],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31669,"minute":43,"hour":21,"day":5,"month":10,"year":2021,"datetime":1636144992785,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":3,"note":"read some 15 pages more and liked it :3\n\nthe book is full of wisdom 😇🍃","note_title":"","tags":[1101],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31670,"minute":12,"hour":21,"day":5,"month":10,"year":2021,"datetime":1636143155781,"timeZoneOffset":3600000,"mood":3,"note":"woke up around 6:25, after an AMAZING SLEEP! made awesome oatmeal, this time didn't push myself into eating all of it, I made too much again but that's fine :) \n\nGot to school by 7:40 and the day started of with history! it was just fine honestly, I liked it, we did the Roman empire!!!

Then literature and examination, and I ... had some troubles on the way, but ... MADE IT! YEAH!

time to sum up the day isn't it.\n\nwoke up, make porridge which honestly was meh today, I used to much water unfortunately, breakfast meh.\n\nthen immediately the first lesson I've gone through was German and well, the teached had begun examinating, and I was like \"well there is a volunteer so that should be ok\", then she was like \"oh ok, you're still not done with this all, let's examine one person more!, no volunteer this time?\" and I was like \"oh dear lord she'll examine me won't she, I'm absolutely sure\", \"Matyáš it is!\", and in that moment I couldn't really believe, I just sat there and then torture had begun. \"what happened\", \"was is passiert\", most of things I figured out either through direct English translation or I didn't figure them out at all, \"alright, looks like something between 2 and 3, but it will be a 2\", and I just happily thanked and left, felt so relieved.\n\nthen more lessons came and my mood began to shift to the bluish side, the question that hit me was \"why should we as speices keep moving forward?\" but over social sciences I kinda found out the answer\n\n\"we are given the opportunity to live to exploit our lifes for as much happiness as is available, though as counterintuitive as it might seem, true happiness can only be achieved if one experiences true sadness as well, happy life is a mixture of sad and happy moments, happy life is a life one will not regret, this applies to an individual just as it does to a society\"\n\nthen lunch which was honestly terrible, but then a simply amazing talk with Majda downstairs, we were in a full room and just chatted personally, felt so good\n\nthen physics and that was fairly good, and english where we did idioms, I quite liked that\n\nafter school I went to buy catfood and went to granny's, glad I visited her!\n\nafter we got home I took the dog for a walk and after that I did school stuff and had dinner\n\nonce all that was done my calendar came screaming at me I should call my (other) grandma, at first that seemed inconceivable, but as time passed it seemed more and more realistic, I was struggling to find the strength in me to do it, like really struggling, but I did it, grandma told me some stuff and it were a very pleasant 5 mins, when she said \"it's kind of you you called\" I literally melted :3\n\nthen I exercised though I didn't watch any video, not better

day, lemme explain it all\n\nwoke up for the first time around 5.30 and actually just fell asleep, I knew that if she hasn't responded the day prior she'd not answer until like 6.15 so yh, but around those 6:30 when I woke up again, I saw ... nothing, she didn't respond, and I would literally cry if hadn't had to go to school, but, I held the tears 🥲 While we drove to school I listened to some sad & emotional songs, but primarily driver's licence that just got stuck in my head in when I woke up, in school I didn't see her at all, I just waited the whole free period very calmly in our classroom and, while mentally sad, everything was ... fine? but THEN I got a notification that she replied and I RUSHED downstairs to tell Ondra, I was literally so filled with emotions!!! So cool! And my happiness kinda fueled the day! She replied with \"hi, surely we can go somewhere sometime, but I won't be able to make it anytime soon as I have to get through some stuff\", kinda neutral? But let's not get into the feelings yet! The school was fine, actually, when we waited for lunch, my cousin was right behind me and she said \"your hair is just the right length, it don't look bad\" which just made me a little happier! Then PE I enjoyed surprisingly much, we ran those 1800m and I enjoyed it?! I know weird, I just ENJOYED a run, incredible, then I went home by train, it took me a while, but I made it, I listened to podcasts and overall, I was okay 👍 Then I stayed at home for a while and I kinda solved one of my crises, you know, I was wondering, the girl plays handball as her hobby, Ondra plays baseball as his hobby, Bobik & Eda play chess as their hobby, shouldn't I have something as well? I was like, everyone has something, except me? But today I wanted to find what I missed and I found a hidden gold, me from March 2021 saying that I have all 5 hobbies I need in life and immediately all my worries kinda disappeared, no need to look for what I love, I knew it half a year ago, I just forgot that I love it. Yh and the last thing I did today was essentially going on a wonderful walk while the sun casted its last lightbeams, I thought about it all & I posted to Instagram...\n\nBut let's get to the feelings...\n\nRight now I feel meh, but this is a day summary, so I should sum up the whole day... She responded and I appreciate that, but she kinda ignored all the \"emotional\" there was in that message, I for sure am overthinking this all, but honestly, I don't know whether I can keep believing that she likes me back (no, she didn't tell me or anything, but it's kind of a condition to have a crush on someone isn't it, if they don't at least like you as well it kinda loses all meaning), I just find it all kinda weird. She has to get through some stuff, \"vyřešit a urovnat\", and honestly, this got me thinking, does it involve me? No, probably not, but does it mean that she is actually insecure about something? Because knowing that there is another human being insecure about something would mean a world to me, I really just want to talk with someone honestly 😞 Verča (my exgf) told me how she and her current bf got together (may sound weird but that thing was a while back), and I just kinda learned, it needs some time, time resolves it all. I want answers right now and I want to know them all, but I don't think I should know them, I will not know them for a while, maybe never... Verča also said that I can't afford to pretend not interested rn, but what should I do instead? Just text her? Probably? I don't know, I'll try my best?

I won't remember it, but it was nice!\n\nQuick summary, got to school by 7:40, didn't see the girl, first lesson chemistry, wrote a new test, learned that from the one before I got a 3, not great not terrible I guess, then English, I wrote another test, alright I guess, then Maths where we just continued with repetition, fairly easy, fairly boring, then Czech, where we just wrote some more stuff down, them geography and another test came (I think it was alright) and the day ended with a bit of interesting molecular biology (I'm planning on getting myself tested from this one tomorrow, wish me luck!) 🤗 Lunch was okay, I talked to Nela and her friends some small talk, sat next to my girl-friends in canteen and told a guy with a \"seek discomfort\" hoodie \"nice hoodie bro\", kinda glad! I was very social today overall 👍 Got home by train and walked those 4km home, just quite nice to be honest! Got home by 16h and just chillaxed ever after, actually, I went for a walk with my dog, but nothing special after all, just a very casual day 😇\n\nBut tomorrow probably won't be this casual! Let me present to you \"the plan™\", tomorrow, me and Marketka we should have a common free period, and I will see her (>99% probability), have an opportunity to talk to her (>80% probability), so hopefully, if I don't manage to ask her on the \"date\" tomorrow, I'll try on Thursday and if even then I fail I'll simply text her, it's a pretty straightforward roadmap and I REALLY home I'll ask her tomorrow, it shouldn't be that tough after all! I'm just kinda afraid, not of the answer, honestly, I don't even know what I'm afraid of, I just know I'm afraid, but I'll try my best, if I could tell a 2 years older guy that he has a nice hoodie (no subtext whatsoever), I can ask HER! Just be as nice as possible! And kind! And treat her right if it works!! My plan on our date is to just talk, I was wondering whether we couldn't go to the \"terassa\" café, which would be nice, but I don't know, the riverside seems just easier and also we might get to talk more this way, so I might go for that, I'll probably ask her what she thinks though ;) So yh, good luck!😇\n\nMake tomorrow good, just do it, I know that it depends on the coincidence, but if tomorrow you'll write here, that you had a chance and simply didn't use it, I'll be sad, bro, just try it!!!

First we saw the Wenceslav square, and just went for lunch, the lunch was genuinely good! Even though my sense of taste is kinda muted, I liked it! Then we went to the National Museum for that Egyptian exhibition, it was really good! I liked! The exhibits were not as amazing, but the execution was real really good! Then we walked through the city center and then bought me some really cool shoes! I deserved ones! We stop under the Golden arches and went for a train back, got to train by 17:30 and on our way back I texted w\/ all of my friends, by 18:45 we were in Pilsen and by 19:15 happily home!\n\nReally good day after all!\n\nWe also decided, that I WON'T go to the Fykos soustředění, Eda's mum won't let him, mine probably won't let me either and I don't really want to go either, also Majda kinda helped me decide, if I don't want to do it, then just don't do it!

Well, I dunno, but here is a couple of things I wanna do, long term and short term.\n\n1) I have to go on a date with that gal', I just have to, any questions? Ask her in person and just, relax & enjoy, even though you've never done it  (& I doubt that she has), it's probably gonna be just fine, you had that semi-date once and even though Verča said it was terrible you liked it anyway, so don't worry, and do it, and ask her out if you still like her!\n\n2) be kinder to people, but so far it only involved my friends, but what about my family? They are super important, and I sometimes get mean at them, so avoid that, and get comfy with being nice to them as well!\n\n3) enjoy the autumn! you know, what is the most \"proud to be European\" feeling you get? Probably riding a tram in the downtown when the evenings are long and temps wobble around 0 ain't that right? so ENJOY the autumn, sure, it's not AS cool and winter and spring, but it's got some magic as well, so play along with the magic and enjoy!\n\nThat's just some of it, but really, just, enjoy and do your best, that sums it up the best don't it?\n\nHave a wonderful autumn...\n\n& recover from your 'coldie'!","note_title":"","tags":[1189,1137,1131],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31893,"minute":36,"hour":11,"day":19,"month":8,"year":2021,"datetime":1632044212106,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"In Prague!😇\n\nedit.: 🎵Party tattoos 🎵","note_title":"","tags":[],"assets":[108],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31894,"minute":58,"hour":20,"day":18,"month":8,"year":2021,"datetime":1631991512512,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"Not that bad, I just needed to sort everything out :)","note_title":"","tags":[],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31895,"minute":52,"hour":19,"day":18,"month":8,"year":2021,"datetime":1631987566453,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":5,"note":"I feel terrible","note_title":"","tags":[],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":31896,"minute":14,"hour":19,"day":18,"month":8,"year":2021,"datetime":1631985244407,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"I've finished the first episode of season 3 of Sex Education and it's been AMAZING!!!

But by Thursday I woke up and the reply to my \"good night\" was kinda disappointing, I know, I'm terribly overthinking this, but what choice do I have, that's all the social interaction I have with her, school was also rather disappointing, I saw the girl at lunch and she's still lovely, but I just, didn't feel all that good, I sat onto that treehouse and recorded a ridiculously long voice memo, and this was a small high, I asked her whether she'd not want to go somewhere, and she's busy, and she's not lying, I'm sure about that, but understandably it didn't help my overall mood much, by Friday early in the morning I woke up with terrible vertigo dizzy as fuck, couldn't even walk, was vomiting, just terrible, on Friday I stayed at home kinda sick, but it just got worse with me trying to do the physics problem while having cold feet, that just wasn't as good, but I actually got to read Kytice, what a wonderful book, I absolutely loved it and I so peacefully fell asleep after reading about 80 pages, I woke up around 16h to my mother yelling at me, and the details are in the voice memo, Kytice was a small high, waking up to my mum yelling was a small low, yesterday evening I fell asleep pretty late and overall got \"meh\" sleep, overall just my sleep isn't all that good nowadays ;(\n\nSo this is a pretty good explanation of what happened, but what about the future?

After that we had the last period ~ English, where we just talked, it was very nice to be perfectly honest, I liked it, but partly, just because I'm really happy now 🤗 Then I headed from school with Ondra and Martin and I saw her again! This time, just saw :( Me and Ondra then went into the shopping mall, where we just bought some stuff, once I got to Grandma's I read the message the girl texted me in the morning and we chatted for a while, she's amazing, really really amazing, I really really like her, I've gotta ask her on a date at least (yh, I've technically done that already, but shush), in the evening I went on my routine walk and just thought, the weather is a little cloudy today, so I didn't really get to be happy happy, but I'm just happy today 😂 At home I made myself some yoghurt with musli and watched the TV, nice

úžasná (🤩), teď třetí týden což je velký otazník 😂 Asi bych mohl i zhodnotit samotný školní rok, bylo to víc fajn než jsem očekával 😌 V tom květnu jsem se strašně moc držel toho \"snu\", prostě jsem každý den čekal že se s týpkou něco stane a každej den jsem byl zklamaný 😑 Ale pak po mé legendární procházce jsem si to v hlavě trošku přehodnotil a v červnu už jsem se toho tolik nedržel, a i přesto že jsem čekal že červen bude skvělej, tak byl ještě lepší než jsem očekával 🤩 Ten poslední týden byl prostě top, to nějak nezměním ❤️❤️ Pořád mě mrzí že jsem s týpkou nic neudělal, měl jsem neskutečný šance, ale proč to uspěchat, hlavně to teď ne overthinkovat a ono si to pro mě přijde samo, já tomu musím jenom trochu dopomoci 👍 V tom červnu jsem si uvědomil jak skvělý kamarády já vlastně mám, jsou to úžasný lidi 🤩 Tak takhle asi pro teď končím, ještě si odpočinout a za 35 minut jdu 👍 🎵 ALL WE GOT 🎵","note_title":"","tags":[1188],"assets":[73],"isFavorite":false},{"id":32072,"minute":2,"hour":21,"day":18,"month":6,"year":2021,"datetime":1626634921100,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":2,"note":"What

V IG biu má \"is there any life on mars\", což je můj obor ngl 😅 A dokonce, když jsem jí tak klasicky averzně (jako její ex) říkal že by se neměla nějak opíjet, ona se sice nejdřív naštvala, ale pak mi vysvětlila jak to myslela a já jsem uznal svou chybu, za což ne pochválila, neat! 👍 Pořád je ale hoe, ale aspoň to mezi sebou máme urovnaný však víš 😅 V ten pátek jsme si úžasně se všema popovídali, fakt, kamaráde! 🤗 Na oběd jsem opustil chudáka Okynu a sedl si k holkám lol, a šíleně jsme se nasmáli, nad dopravním korigátorem Hájkovou etcetera, skvělý!

fajn dopoledne 👍 Napíšu trochu delší záznam protože nemám co dělat 😂 Nejdřív bylo ZSV, kde jsme probírali ekonomiku, přičemž jsem se samozřejmě já a Filip pořád na něco ptali, nedozvěděli jsme vůbec nic, ale aspoň jsme mohli zaflexit, potom byla anglina na kterou jsme měli Boříkovou, ta její výslovnost mi hrozně chyběla samozřejmě 😅 Řešili jsme hudbu, tak jsem sem tam něco zablábolil 😂 Potom jsme měli němčinu, kde jsme probírali skloňování neurčitého členů, zatím to jakž takž zvládám, ale bojím se výsledků toho testu, vůbec se mi nepovedl!😅 Potom chemie na který jsme opakovali názvosloví, což jsem zvládal na pohodku 👍 Potom fyzika, a ten test nedopadl 😟 Měli jsme na to brutálně málo času, takže trojka nebo čtyřka no 😅 I když, mě to může být i celkem jedno 🤗 Nakonec čeština, na který jsme nejdřív dělali zápisky, ale skončili jsme u čtení slohovek 👍 Potom jsme šli na oběd a believe or not zas tam byla ta typka, unbelievable, gosh, she's soooo pretty, but what can I do uh 😅 Oběd byl celkem hnusnej, nejhnusnější byla tatarská omáčka, bleh, potom jsme s Majdou, Bobíkem, Matyášem Landou a Martinem šli do Sadů Pětatřicátníků, believe it or not, ta týpka šla za náma s jinou týpkou a tím klukem lol No došli jsme na tramvaj a já odjel, tu týpku jsem pak už neviděl no, co se dá dělat, i don't really care all that much😅 Nevertheless, it's time, jak jsem na tom teďka you may ask 😅 Upřímně, po mém sobotním relaxu už to tolik neřeším, došel jsem k závěru, že nemá smysl to nějak extra řešit, considering že s tím stejně nejpravděpodobněji vůbec nic neudělám no 😅 Upřímně, když se na ní podívám, tak si řeknu, \"man she's hot\", ale je prostě taková wayyyy out of my league you get that?😅 Prostě je taková, ehhhhh, dunno how to explain 😅 Prostě když jí zahlídnu, tak si prostě řeknu že je to takový impossible s ní být, i když jakože ne až tak impossible jak se může zdát, ale takový to she's way out of my league tu prostě je a myslím si to 😅 Momentálně s tím nemám v plánu nic moc dělat, je hezká, ale neznám jí ani trochu, jako bylo by mi líto, kdybych na ní roky měl crush a nic s tím neudělal, nebudu kecat, ale how likely is that huh, moc ne, si pamatuju když jsem měl crush na Anku, to bylo taky něco, to jsem se k ničemu nerozhoupal, teď je to o tolikkkl těžší, ale nevím prostě, nechci za ní úplně přijít a \"wow, u'r pretty d'y'now that?\" 😏 I když by to bylo naprosto epický, a semtam si to představuju, tak takovej asi úplně nejsem, moc bych se bál udělat takhle gigantickej krok understand?😅 Zkrátka teďka úplně nevím, v pátek jsem jí (s nějakou 1\/3 jistotou) requestnul o sledování, a samozřejmě mě odmítla (stejně jako každá holka irl huh), pamatuju si že jsem si to přečetl zrovna když jsme s Pájou byli venku a mě to prostě nonunderstandably hrozně mrzelo nu 😅 Furt vzpomínám na ten podzim když se mi líbila, to byly časy, teďka z toho crushovani mám takovej zvláštní pocit, nepopsatelnej, dokonce jsem si pustil krásnej song \"the earth\", ale už mi to nespustilo tu nostalgii, kterou jsem čekal nu 😅 Jsou to zvláštní pocity nevertheless, určitě by mě zajímalo jak to dopadne, ale asi se to nedozvim, pokud se teda suddenly nerozhodnu za ní jít, je to hrozně fucked up, že nevím ani jak se jmenuje, prošla ode mně 20 centimetrů, ale já ani nevím jak se jmenuje, fuck 😅 No uvidíme, snad se to nějak vyvrbí, ale žádný vyloženě plány nemám, už se tím ani netrápím 😅 Co se týče plánu o jiných věcech, tak teď u babi čekám na mamku a píšu záměrně dlouhý záznam, měli bychom jít koupit boty na \"Lipkovice\", mám z toho trochu strach ngl, ale snad to zvládnu 😅 Jinak teďka chodím každý den s Elzou na pořádnou procházku, jen se podívej na záznamy z Mi Fitu!😅 A v pátek alou pěšky domů 🤠 No nic, Maty z budoucnosti, dej vědět, ty víš co mě zajímá (a co tobě je úplně jedno)😅","note_title":"","tags":[1190,1189],"assets":[],"isFavorite":false},{"id":32169,"minute":38,"hour":11,"day":2,"month":5,"year":2021,"datetime":1622626728855,"timeZoneOffset":7200000,"mood":3,"note":"čeká
